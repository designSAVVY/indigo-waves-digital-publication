            <p>Inyoni began to panic. Hadali, the cursed kingdom, seemed larger and deeper than she had imagined. She feared that Orpheus would not be able to withstand the pressure at this depth. The underwater craft’s metal sheets were vibrating, its bars visibly bending under pressure and the windows were beginning to crack. They would not last long. Djibril, the commander-in-chief of the army, stepped into the cabin, visibly agitated.</p>
            <p>“Are you sure we’re going the right way, Inyoni? I feel like we are going deeper than necessary. Going any further down would be too dangerous. We are headed towards disaster! You’ll get us all killed!”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know Djibril. Baobab stopped responding. Look, the monitor just died, due to the pressure. I don’t know what to do. Do you think I should warn Mambamuntu?”</p>
            <p>“I’m afraid so.”</p>
            <p>Samudrakumari and Padaguboodam were impressed by the imposing Fort Kota. It stood on the abyssal plain of Hadali, a vast territory feared by all. For many years, this kingdom had enjoyed a relatively quiet reign that was however suddenly disrupted by the Zungarees, who had fled their star system after the invasion of the Two-Paws. Originally, the Zungarees were peaceful creatures who had always coexisted in harmony with their neighbours – until the day the Two-Paws invaded.</p>
            <p>The latter, a bloodthirsty species that had destroyed the planet Earth, their home for thousands of years, had left it to conquer space, in the course of which they chased the Zungarees out of their stellar system. The Zungarees had no choice but to leave these skies and were condemned to exile. After years of wandering, they left to explore the depths of the seas on several other planets. Finally, they found refuge in Hadali. The Hadalians were a millennia-old people who, despite their wealth and deep knowledge of the universe, lived a quiet existence in their isolated kingdom. Their remarkable wisdom and profound sense of justice had kept them out of the conflicts and wars of other realms. So when the Zungarees came seeking refuge, the Hadalians saw fit to help them and welcomed them with open arms.</p>
            <h5 id="how-could-they-have-suspected-that-this-unfortunate-decision-would-prove-fatal-to-their-peaceful-existence">How could they have suspected that this unfortunate decision would prove fatal to their peaceful existence?</h5>
            <p>Shortly after they arrived, the Zungarees discovered something that would forever change the course of the Hadali kingdom’s history.</p>
            <p>Far from the abyssal plain of Hadali was a secret territory that the Hadalians kept under guard. No one was allowed to visit it. The Hadalians allowed the Zungarees to stay in their kingdom on the condition that they respect this golden rule: No one was allowed to enter this forbidden place. At first, the Zungarees refrained from visiting this secret area, despite their growing curiosity. But since rules are made to be broken, they ended up taking advantage of the Hadalians’ benevolence to satisfy their desire to know more. When they ventured into the forbidden place, they realised that they could no longer be content to remain mere guests in the kingdom of Hadali: In reality, this forbidden territory consisted of underwater mines brimming with minerals that were highly coveted by underwater dwellers across the universe. The Hadalians’ worst fear came true: to profit from the thousands of polymetallic nodules containing nickel, manganese, cobalt, gold, copper and other minerals that the universe needed, the Zungarees seized power over the kingdom and enslaved the Hadalians. As their greed grew day by day, they soon realised that the people they had enslaved were too few to work the mines. The Zungarees needed new resources. They decided to go look elsewhere for other people to enslave.</p>
            <p>“We must hurry, Samudrakumari. We don’t have much time.”</p>
            <p>“I know, Padaguboodam. Mackouhanuman will join us at any moment with his army. I hope nothing bad happens to Muthukaruppan.”</p>
            <p>Hiding behind a mountain, the two friends watched – fascinated and frightened – as people came and went through the underwater city’s huge gate. Menacing-looking Makaras, creatures with elephant trunks, alligator teeth and fish tails, were standing guard around the fortress. They were the new mercenaries that the Zungarees had captured to work as guards. The air was thick with nervous tension. Something was not right. No sooner had the inhabitants passed through the gate that they came back with their arms fully loaded, piling things into huge submarines that were leaving for an unknown destination. It looked like the city was being drained of its population.</p>
            <p>“Do you have a plan?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t but Mackouhanuman does.”</p>
            <p>“But time is running out! Each second we lose can be fatal. I don’t even know if your lover is still alive.”</p>
            <p>“Shut up, Padaguboodam. Don’t talk about death! It’s bad luck.”</p>
            <p>“Actually, how did you meet Muthukaruppan?"</p>
            <h5 id="shortly-after-they-seized-power-in-hadali-the-zungarees-set-out-to-look-for-other-people-to-enslave-across-the-vast-underwater-world.">Shortly after they seized power in Hadali, the Zungarees set out to look for other people to enslave across the vast underwater world.</h5>
            <p>They tricked their way into different kingdoms, posing as traders and navigators to first infiltrate them and then take over and then capture people who they enslaved and brought back to Hadali.</p>
            <p>Muthukaruppan placed a necklace made of sea flowers around Mambamuntu’s neck. She cupped his face in her hands and kissed him passionately. A murmuration of cormorants passed through the yellow sky. Muthukaruppan was about to depart. The two lovers had met at the edge of the red river, true to their habits.<br />
            “It’s just a few days, Mambamuntu. I’ll be back very soon, my darling.”<br />
            “I know, my love. But I am worried about you.”<br />
            As was the custom, the groom was to bring back the “Star of Happiness” to his fiancée as a sign of bravery. This star was in a faraway dangerous territory swarming with pirates and slavers.<br />
            Mambamuntu was right to be concerned. Recently, several patrols had reported unusual movement in the area.<br />
            “Promise me you’ll come back. Don’t forget that soon we are to be united in marriage.”<br />
            Mambamuntu gently kissed his forehead and watched him leave, stricken by sadness.</p>
            <p>Muthukaruppan and the other enslaved prisoners were taken to the kingdom of Creyolistan. Its inhabitants, the Creyolis, were half human and half fish.</p>
            <p>Creyolistan had once been part of the mythical lost continent Kumarikandam. Back then, Creyolistan was called Mauritia. It was a place cursed by the gods, inhabited only by enslaved people and labourers who had been brought from all over Kumarikandam to work the land, as the Tritanis, the inhabitants of Kumarikandam, considered it degrading to touch the ground. Then one day the great catastrophe struck. The different speeds at which the planet’s poles and its equator were rotating created an unbearable tension, finally causing the planet’s mantle to warp, breaking apart the continents. Kumarikandam fractured into many pieces and sank to the bottom of the ocean. While some parts disappeared completely without a trace, others survived in total isolation, as the underwater population was not particularly interested in them. Mauritia was one of the territories that had broken away from Kumarikandam, taking with it the enslaved people, servicemen and different peoples of the continent who had survived the catastrophe. While before, they had lived among their respective ethnic groups, they now had found themselves living together in Mauritia, sharing a common destiny. They formed a new people called the Creyoli and renamed Mauritia Creyolistan. All was well until the day when the Zungarees burst into this peaceful territory. They threatened to kill Karuppusamy, the king of Creyolistan, if he did not accept their conditions. They demanded that he give them the right to use his territory as a halfway point where the enslaved people they had brought would be kept until being sent onward to their final destination, Hadali.<br />
            The ruler had no choice but to accept this request – which was really more of a threat – or he would not only lose his kingdom but also put the life of his beloved daughter Samudrakumari at risk. Peaceful Creyolistan was transformed into a penal colony from which only complaints and lamentations escaped. It could not escape its curse...</p>
            <h5 id="when-she-first-caught-sight-of-him-samudrakumari-could-not-take-her-eyes-off-him.-it-was-a-sweltering-summer-evening.-the-air-was-heavy-the-breeze-refused-to-rise-and-the-leaves-of-the-motionless-trees-seemed-to-be-dozing-in-the-heat.">When she first caught sight of him, Samudrakumari could not take her eyes off him. It was a sweltering summer evening. The air was heavy, the breeze refused to rise and the leaves of the motionless trees seemed to be dozing in the heat.</h5>
            <p>Even though her father had forbidden it, Samudrakumari had come to the banks of the Pagliyaru, the beautiful purple river that ran through their area, with her friends to get some fresh air. They had sorely missed playing by the river. It was their favourite place to pick flowers and swim.<br />
            Since the enslaved prisoners were on the other side of the river, there was, in principle, no risk of seeing them nor of being reprimanded by the Zungaree guards. After picking some flowers, they decided to go for a swim. They approached the shore and that’s when Samudrakumari saw him. Alone in the river, Muthukaruppan seemed to be meditating. Phosphorescent stars floating all around him enveloped him in a glowing god-like aura. The two moons seemed to shine even brighter, illuminating his sculpted, athletic body. There was something fascinating about this man, something regal. Samudrakumari was curious to know who he was. Men and women were strolling around in the enclosure they were kept in, under the watchful eye of the guards. Having sensed their presence, Muthukaruppan opened his eyes and saw the girls looking at him. He was surprised to see them and gazed at them in wonder. It was his first time ever seeing Creyolis, for since their arrival they had been living in isolation, only among other men and women destined for Hadali.<br />
            They struck him as beautiful, with their half-human half-fish bodies. But his admiring rêverie was cut short when a guard approached and ordered him to get out of the water. It was with great regret that Muthukaruppan left to join his companions. However, just before leaving, he had caught an enigmatic sparkle in the girl’s eyes.</p>
            <p>“So you’ve never spoken to him?” Padaguboodam asked, bewildered.<br />
            “No... But we communicated without words,” Samudrakumarir replied hesitantly, embarrassed by this unexpected question. “I used to go see him often. I would hide and watch him discreetly. But he was no fool. He knew I was there. He felt my presence but never dared to approach me. I don’t know if it was for fear of punishment or simply because he was not interested in me. But I was starting to fall for him. I wanted him. I wanted him to stay with us. I wanted to take him out of the miserable condition he was in. I wanted to become one with him. My father panicked when I told him about my decision. He wanted so much to grant my wish – he never refused anything I asked him for. But he feared the wrath of the Zungarees and, knowing my stubbornness, he thought it best to send me to you. I beg your pardon for having made up this romance between Muthukaruppan and me. But I had no choice. I really want to save him. Do you understand?”<br />
            “I should have known. I’m so stupid! How could you have been able to talk to him, given your father’s restrictions and next to all these guards. But do you realise the risk you are running by coming here to save him? You don’t even know if he loves you.”<br />
            “I know all that, Padaguboodam. I know I’m taking a huge risk. It doesn’t matter if he loves me or not. It’s about saving him from this bad fate.”<br />
            “I knew that you were a whimsical person, Samudrakumari, but to take such a huge risk is beyond unreasonable. And what shall I tell your father? As his best friend and ally, I never went against his will. I should have told him and I’m sorry I didn’t. You’re going to get me in trouble, girl.”<br />
            “My father would be proud of his daughter. Anyway, everyone would celebrate the Zungarees’ downfall. It’s high time their reign came to an end. If we had anything to do with it, my father would be more than happy. Trust me, we’re on the right side of history. How about you think a little about our strategy instead of questioning everything,” she said, half smiling, half angry. “Look, here comes your General Mackouhanuman. He must have a plan.”<br />
            “So here is the latest news,” Mackouhanuman, the amphibian monkey, announced. He was a formidable warrior and an excellent strategist. His squadrons were feared by all armies. He was the only one who could save Muthukaruppan from this nightmare.</p>
            <p>Mambamuntu awoke with a start. Something was not right. She opened the door of her cabin only to come face to face with Djibril, who explained the situation to her.<br />
            “How much further is it?”<br />
            “No idea, Mambamuntu. All I know is that we’re running a huge risk if we go any lower. Orpheus won’t make it.”<br />
            Mambamuntu looked distraught. They were far from their home territory and she knew of no one nearby they could ask for help.<br />
            “Inyoni, do you know where we are?”<br />
            “We don’t know, Mambamuntu. Baobab stopped working. We were close to Creyolistan when it broke down.”<br />
            “Creyolistan? What is that?”<br />
            “It’s the kingdom of the Creyolis. It used to be part of Kumarikandam but broke away,” Djibril answered. “But wait, Inyoni. If we were in the vicinity of Creyolistan just now, it means that we’ve gone down too far. Because Creyolistan is in the deepest abyss, isn’t it?”<br />
            “You’re right. Why didn’t I think of that earlier?”<br />
            “Come on, let’s go back up as fast as we can. Get everyone ready!”</p>
            <h5 id="mambamuntu-felt-energised-by-this-latest-information.-it-was-time-to-bring-muthukaruppan-home.-she-couldnt-wait-any-longer.">Mambamuntu felt energised by this latest information. It was time to bring Muthukaruppan home. She couldn’t wait any longer.</h5>
            <p>After more than two years away, her fiancé still had not returned. Mambamuntu had moved heaven and earth to find out what had happened to him. No one could give her a concrete answer. Some said he was dead; there were rumors that he had run off with a secret lover. But Mambamuntu refused to believe these rumors. She was convinced that something bad had happened to Muthukaruppan. But what it was, she could not say. One day, a sailor came to see her. He had just returned from a long journey. He told her that while he was in Creyolistan, he had heard about a certain Muthukaruppan. He told her that the young man had been kidnapped by the Zungarees who enslaved him and took him to Hadali. Despite the bad news, Mambamuntu was overjoyed. So he was not dead! It was absolutely necessary to go look for him and to find him as soon as possible. Bad things were in store for Hadali. Several rulers of other kingdoms had their sights set on Hadali, scheming to conquer it and take advantage of its riches. The Zungarees were constantly on guard. Yet the Gautar, conquerors from very far away, managed to attack Hadali and were about to completely seize power over the kingdom. When Mambamuntu heard this news, she decided to go to Hadali. She gathered her army of Lwas. The Gautar attack would offer an opportunity to save Mambamuntu, she thought. Mackouhanuman’s strategic plan was based on the same idea.</p>
            <p>“Who are they?” Samudrakumari asked, surprised, looking at the newcomers who were also trying to hide behind the mountain.<br />
            “I don’t know. Do you, Mackouhanuman?”<br />
            “It’s Mambamuntu, the Taino princess, with her army of Lwas.”<br />
            “What is she doing here?” Samudrakumari looked worried. “Can you send someone to find out what they are doing here?”<br />
            “There’s no need, Samudrakumari, my spies have already told me.”<br />
            “So?”<br />
            Mackouhanuman was about to answer but was interrupted by a loud noise. An explosion. The entrance gate collapsed. Three more explosions followed, bringing down all the entry points. Hundreds of AMX 500s rushed into the fort and attacked the Zungarees, who fled without really resisting. The Gautar army was too powerful. They had carefully orchestrated the attack to leave the Zungarees no chance to strike back. Taking advantage of the attack, Djibril and Mackouhanuman regrouped their armies and went in search of the enslaved prisoners. Getting rid of the guards and the tiny Zungaree squadron was child’s play for the two generals. But when they reached the citadel, they found no one there.<br />
            “Where are they?” Worried, Mambamuntu asked Djibril, who was also wondering the same. He looked for Mackouhanuman but did not find him. Something told him that Mackouhanuman knew where the prisoners were. He was not wrong at all, for Mackouhanuman had indeed already found the dungeon in which Muthukaruppan and his friends were held. But a bad surprise awaited them.<br />
            “Mackouhanuman, what is going on?”</p>
            <h5 id="samudrakumari-could-not-believe-his-eyes.-thousands-of-starfish-were-interlocking-with-each-other-to-form-a-wall-all-around-the-men-and-women-who-were-helplessly-watching-this-extraordinary-phenomenon.">Samudrakumari could not believe his eyes. Thousands of starfish were interlocking with each other to form a wall all around the men and women, who were helplessly watching this extraordinary phenomenon.</h5>
            <p>“What are these stars doing?” Mambamuntu asked. Mackouhanuman looked grim.<br />
            “We must hurry! We’re running out of time. The Zungarees are walling up Muthukaruppan and the other enslaved people.”<br />
            “They are walling them up? But how?”<br />
            “You see these starfish? Thousands of them? Well, they were programmed to form a wall around the prisoners in the event of an attack.”<br />
            “But why? That’s monstrous!”<br />
            “It’s to safeguard their treasure. All the mining systems and access codes to the mines are locked up in this dungeon. The Zungarees think immuring the prisoners willl keep their treasure safe until they return.”<br />
            “So what are you waiting for? Get rid of these stars and free Muthukaruppan! Come on, we must attack!” Mambamuntu was about to attack the starfish.<br />
            “It’s not that easy, Mambamuntu,” Mackouhanuman countered. “These stars are not real. I mean, they are not physically real. They are virtual stars.”<br />
            “What should we do then? We can’t just sit here and leave these men and women behind this wall.” Samudrakumari looked distraught.<br />
            “For God’s sake, Djibril, do something! I didn’t come all this way to see him vanish like that,” Mambamuntu pleaded with her army general.<br />
            “Padaguboodam is the only person who can save us. Where is he anyway?”<br />
            Mackouhanuman set off in search of Padaguboodam. The others followed.</p>
            <p>“Sepdt, Pô Tolo, Sigui Tolo…” Padaguboodam mumbled incomprehensible words while drawing mysterious signs in the yellow sky. His Kanaga mask gave him a strange air that Samudrakumari had never seen before.<br />
            “Padaguboodam is not only the King of Sakalavanur but he is also the great spiritual master of the Mask Society. As such, he knows the science and secrets of the stars. To stop the starfish from forming this wall, he must manage to align the stars in the sky – this will stop this diabolical process. This is no small task. Come on, let him do his work. We just have to pray that he succeeds.” While Mambamuntu and Samudrakumari discreetly went away, Mackouhanuman gathered everyone else and retreated a little further away.<br />
            Padaguboodam began with Dama movements. This dance had the power to chase away death. Then he moved Sigui Tolo to the right of Pô Tolo. Pô Tolo is the heaviest star. It contains the three primordial elements: water, fire and air. It is the most important star that maintains the alignment. It is solid yet flexible enough to allow for multiple combinations.<br />
            Then he asked the star Emma Ya to move a little lower next to Nommo. He moved Yorugu next to Khartikya and Tarakya. This alignment allows the other stars to keep a regular curve. This is very important to stop the starfish. And he moved the last Dana Tolo to the end of the line. That would be enough. Tired but content, he left to find Mackouhanuman and his friends.</p>
            <p>Muthukaruppan felt that something was happening. The starfish seemed to start behaving erratically and to slow down. When they had seen the thousands of stars closing in around them, Muthukaruppan and his friends had been gripped by panic. It had only taken a few minutes for them to realise that the Zungarees had decided to immure them alive. Was this the way this life would end? Dying without seeing his beloved again seemed deeply unjust. Would he, the valiant warrior of Sakalavanur, have to die like this? What a disgrace! He did not mind dying – but not under these conditions! However, it was better to die than to live enslaved by those damned Zungarees. The wall was growing denser by the minute. There was nothing left to do. He closed his eyes to summon Mambamuntu’s face in his mind’s eye. He might as well leave this life thinking of his beloved rather than having to see those cursed starfish closing in on them. But suddenly he heard cries of joy. He opened his eyes again: The wall was collapsing; the starfish were scattering. And then he saw her, he saw her smile – she was there: Mambamuntu, ready to welcome him in her arms. Tears of happiness were running down her cheeks. She was laughing and crying at the same time. He left the dungeon and ran into her arms.</p>
            <p>Mambamuntu, Muthukaruppan and the Lwas army bade farewell to Karuppusamy and prepared to leave Creyolistan. Inyoni switched on Orpheus and programmed the route to Sakalavanur.<br />
            “By the way, something is off... I feel like I haven’t seen Djibril on board,” Muthukaruppan, worried, asked Mambamuntu.<br />
            “Djibril? You’ll have to ask Samudrakumari,” she answered with a wink.</p>

               <br>

            <p> 
            <strong>Addressing the Swahili Ocean and Afrasian coastlines as repositories of transcultural memory and ancestral belonging, author Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor and John Njenga Karugia, researcher and documentary filmmaker, delve into literary, acoustic and scholarly practices of chronicling maritime cosmopolitanisms and communal histories while also remaining alert to more-than-human custodians of the sea.</strong></p>
            <p>The conversation took place as part of the exhibition <a href="https://www.berlinerfestspiele.de/gropius-bau/programm/2023/ausstellungen/indigo-waves"><span class="underline">Indigo Waves and Other Stories: Re-Navigating the Afrasian Sea and Notions of Diaspora</span></a> (6.4.–13.8.2023), curated by Natasha Ginwala und Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung with Michelangelo Corsaro. The exhibition consisted of two parts that had been composed in resonance, showing concurrently at the Gropius Bau and SAVVYContemporary in Berlin. The conversation was introduced and moderated by Natasha Ginwala. It has been edited for the Gropius Bau Journal.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Natasha Ginwala</strong><sup class="footNote" id="fn2">2</sup>: It’s such a huge pleasure to have with us today people who have been crucial to the shaping of our endeavour here at the Gropius Bau, at SAVVY Contemporary and at Zeitz MOCAA: “Indigo Waves and Other Stories: Re-Navigating the Afrasian Sea and Notions of Diaspora”. This project wouldn’t be what it is without the voices and the work of people like Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor and John Njenga Karugia.</p>
            <p>I see both of you as inhabitants and travelers – “Jahazis” as poet Haji Gora Haji would put it – of the Swahili seas connecting us to the multitudinous past but also complicating the idea of Kenya today through the intrinsic notion of diasporic cultures and Afro-Asian imaginaries. The politics of naming is something that we must all wrestle with. You both have done it in academic work, in literary work and you’ve spoken about it extensively. I wonder at this time where there is this push towards a certain currency around the Indian Ocean World or it as a sort of subset of study and categorisation: How do we escape the traps that come with a certain regionalism? What does the politics of naming have to do with it?</p>
            <p><strong>John Njenga Karugia</strong><sup class="footNote" id="fn3">3</sup>: There is everything cosmopolitan about the Indian Ocean. I think cosmopolitanism is about dialogue, cosmopolitanism is about taking responsibility, the idea of taking your responsibility towards others seriously. So, in the sense of the politics of naming then to call a shared space, a shared waters, “Indian” is already very problematic because it transports the Indian subcontinent and the Indian nation and excludes many others.</p>
            <p><strong>Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor</strong> <sup class="footNote" id="fn4">4</sup>: I think it’s even more serious than that and linked to the history of what I call the evacuation of all African agency. There was a malice that came from those who invaded that space, that cosmopolitan, that global space and decided that the narrative of especially African agency of the waters does not fit the taxonomy created with that pigmentation hierarchy by some of those idiots, including Carl Linnaeus<sup class="footNote" id="fn5">5</sup></a>. The offence that the latter Portuguese and the English felt when they had to confront the reality that there was a navigational history; navigational methods; a history of trade that did not centre or involve the West at all. Life had been going on, especially in this global monsoon complex, where the West was peripheral. The African person, the person whose skin was dark, had played a very pivotal role. It wasn’t about dominance but involvement and agency around trade, around history, around education, technology and around the ocean. There were all these stupid mythologies that the African was terrified of the ocean. The Africans’ engagement with the ocean was limited to the shoreline as artisanal fishermen or they were cargo on somebody else’s ship going off to be sold as slaves. There were over 300 types of ships and a lot of them were being built in places along the East African coast, like Pate Island. The vestiges are still there. Yet, there was this need to evacuate – and it was quite successful – and remove all sense of the African imaginary. Even within the Indian subcontinent you have the Siddis. They are basically former East Africans who settled in Gujarat in the same way that former Indians settled in parts of East Africa. The Siddis to this day, even in contemporary Indian literature, are referred to as former slaves. I had the privilege of hosting a performance group from Gujarat in East Africa when I was with the Zanzibar Film Festival. They told their own stories of who they are and how they ended up there as sailors, teachers, merchants, adventurers. Not slaves. It’s that same narrative that’s repeated where you find the African diaspora in Persia, or other places. One becomes extremely conscious of what it actually meant to evacuate, erase and remove all African agency and to also deny the historical rootedness of our oceanic imaginary. It’s not just the politics of naming. It’s about the politics of erasure, dehumanisation and evacuation.</p>
            <p><strong>Njenga Karugia</strong>: At the section in the exhibition where my work is shown, there is a photo that I took at the Museum Bahari in Jakarta. Bahr means “ocean” in Arabic, in Indonesian and in Kiswahili it is bahari. In the museum there were about seven rooms trying to recapture the history of arrival of the various ethnic communities into Indonesia and voyagers. The rooms were called “The Room of the Portuguese Sailor”, “The Room of the Japanese Sailor” and so on. Especially disturbing for me was that Vasco da Gama was exhibited there in the form of a huge human cut-out out of cardboard<sup class="footNote" id="fn6">6</sup>. We know from history and from his own diary that he never would have made it all the way to India and other places along the Indian Ocean, be it Kilwa Kisiwani or Malindi, without “pilots”. These pilots were known across the Indian Ocean, across the Afro-Asian Sea, across the Swahili seas. They knew how to read the stars. If you did not know how to read the stars in these geographies and topographies, you would not sail. So, what do I do in such spaces? I arrive there and I realise: “What is going on with the Blackness in this space?” So, I install myself within it and I have somebody take a photo of me just for a moment to say: “Yes, I am the ancestor of those pilots. And although you erase me – well for a moment, I’m here.” And maybe that image will travel around.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Ginwala</strong>: Thinking about orality since we’re addressing erasures, systemic erasures – we’ve also been referencing music and sonic practices in the exhibition. Of course, in my orbit a lot of that also came through Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung, who is the co-conspirator of this project, but also through you, Yvonne. One of the places that we all have now been to is the Dhow CountriesMusic Academy in Zanzibar, which is a major centre to preserve the knowledge of Taarab music, of Kidumbak, of Ngoma and so forth. There is a special mix that was created with students and teachers of the Dhow Countries Music Academy of a track called ‘Pakistan’. It was recorded in Bombay for the first time, but this particular mix was sung in Zanzibar, in Stone Town. So, it is really messing with the geopolitical pressures, it does this incredible sonic circuit – the song ruptures the notion of the nation as a singular space and turns it into lyric. It is also sung in a way that it is passed on in a matrilineal way. Originally, it was composed by Siti binti Saad<sup class="footNote" id="fn7">7</sup>. When I heard it, it was sung by Siti Muharam, who is her great granddaughter. It would be great to discuss the sonic legacy that really is bleed into your work, whether it’s your documentary, dear John, or your writing or the atmosphere in which you breathe in Stone Town while you are imagining the writing that is to come, dear Yvonne.</p>
            <p><strong>Njenga Karugia</strong>: When I listen to the song, I hear the drums of my grandmother in Naivasha. I would call these sounds that I have heard before and that relate to this music “Swahili Sea Music”. I heard these sounds before I ever saw the sea because as a child, I was living about 700 kilometres away from the ocean. The song also takes me to Indonesia. To a time after I had met the ocean and I was studying the ocean. I’m walking in Bandung, which is, for me, the most musical city anywhere in the world – there is music playing everywhere. As I walk down the street, I hear Taarab sounds. This music penetrates my soul – it was probably the most connected music that I’ve felt. Finally, I’ll take you somewhere else: I am somewhere in Ahmedabad in Gujarat at what they call “Siddi compounds”. We are spending an evening in their home, we are in their grandmother’s bedroom, which also serves as a sitting room, and we are exchanging music. The grandmother sings. My ears are trying to listen to her very carefully, but I can’t comprehend what she’s saying. So, I write down the phonetics of what she’s singing – she is actually singing in her Gujarat language; she is singing in Swahili. This is Swahili that has been spoken amongst the African Indians for centuries. She’s singing: “This boy does not have a father and does not have a mother.” The grandmother then realises: “This man says he knows the words of the song and he can tell us what it means.” I said: “I can only tell you a bit of what it means, but I do not know what it means in your context.”<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Adhiambo Owuor</strong>: The song took me back to Zanzibar when I was immersed in the landscape of this incredible music. There are so many varieties of Taarab. Taarab is part of the gift of those seas to this world, to the worlds of the Indian Ocean. You will run into its varieties and variations all along these waters of ours. There’s something more than universal, something fundamental and mysterious about the music. It’s almost as if through song you have a kind of cartography of worlds. The song travels in this incredible way. When you enter into the experience of Taarab, wherever it is you do, it almost opens a door and you enter into it. It’s not music that hits you in the face. It draws you into itself and you are suddenly wandering into its places and spaces, even if you do not understand the words. They say Taarab is an Arabic loanword which I doubt. The scholars that come in later attribute everything to the Arabs or to the Persians, never to the people of the coast. Just because I can and I’m an artist, I’m going to say that Taarab is a Swahili word. I can! Argue with me! It’s the same concept linked to what a lot of you know as the 1001 Nights, which within the Swahili space is known as Alfu Lela Ulela. The Swahili will not say it belongs to them. They’ll say it belongs to all. It belongs to everyone. It’s not attributed to one particular culture or race. It is the very same thing with Taarab.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Ginwala</strong>: It is fascinating to me how it leaks into the space of writing for you. It is something that is very particular. There is that embodied sense of rhythm.</p>
            <p><strong>Adhiambo Owuor</strong>: I use a particular version of Taarab in The Dragonfly Sea that is very well known and has so many variations. Before I begin a story, I have to hear its music. And its music finds me. I don’t look for it. When it comes to me, it’s almost as if I have been given permission now to find the story. The music is like a stream and on the back of the stream of music, the characters then show up.</p>
            <p><strong>Ginwala</strong>: This would be a good moment to think beyond the human protagonists as guardians, also of the sea. It’s something that feels so disruptive to continue to navigate only using the human subject’s perspective. What’s been really incredible is that we have several works in the exhibition that have been pivotal to this project that shift from the human to the beyond human, for example when it comes to the works by the artist Clara Jo. They go to the mineral, they go to the bird, they go to different life forces, which are narrating the stories back to us, reminding us of how this belonging has taken shape.</p>
            <p><strong>Adhiambo Owuor</strong>: As a contemporary world, as a modern world, we are only learning again to be humble enough to hear from the others. The idea of the agencies of other beings. Certainly, when you end up in this world of the Indian Ocean, it’s absolutely fascinating how the lines between worlds are very thin. You will hear of Djinns spoken of as normal in a conversation: “Nadia saw a Djinn last night” – and it’s not a strange conversation at all. Living in Zanzibar, coming back from work late at night you had the idea of presences or long shadows around you that are moving. It is the idea of the capacious self, the idea that there is a place for mystery and for wonder and for strangeness. I hope to pay a lot more tribute to that aspect of our being. I think we need it anyway as part of our humanity.</p>
            <p><strong>Njenga Karugia</strong>: As a young man coming from the hinterland from Naivasha, hundreds of kilometres away from the ocean, I remember we heard stories about Djinns, spirits in the water, and we were warned about them without having ever been to the ocean. These were stories of mermaids and their shadows and their in-betweens. When I was about twenty-one, we went on a university trip to the ocean. My eyes met the eyes of a woman and I thought: “I was told about you. I know who you are.” But she looked so fine. So, I stole another glance and I thought to myself: “Should I risk it all? Do I want to attend the ritual? Do I want to disappear?”</p>
            <p><strong>Ginwala</strong>: Another protagonist who’s been crucial to you, and it’s important to me to pay homage to him, is Haji Gora Haji. Individuals like him, who are poet navigators, conjoin the many things we’ve been speaking about.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Adhiambo Owuor</strong>: Haji Gora Haji died two years ago. He was the unofficial poet laureate of Tanzania. His work was more than sublime. He’d be called in for national celebrations to do the kind of Utendi, the recitals, in any one of the versions of poetic forms that he knew. But he was also regarded as a gadfly, a kind of a subversive figure. The state would never give him an award for the simple reason that he would show up at a national celebration, do his incredible poetry, leave and two days later the state government and officials would realise that they had been insulted and abused and made mockery of completely. They couldn’t summon him because he would be very innocent. He would say: “No, I was talking about a butterfly!” Haji Gora Haji proceeded to become one of the finest mentors that a human being could ever ask for. He started life off as a fisherman; he was a minstrel. He came from one of the marginalised islands of Zanzibar called Tumbatu that has a long history with Persia, what we now know of as Iran. He had this way of reading the waters. He’s the character that inspires the character of Muhidin in The Dragonfly Sea. If you could say that there was a figure in the world that wrote the sea, that gave a biography of the sea, that named the waters, that delivered its metaphors in the most unexpected and beautiful ways – it was this man of Tumbatu but yet a man of worlds of the Indian Ocean. He had this way of speaking the world. One time when I went to meet him for an interview, I had been infected by the alleged anxieties about the Chinese returning to East Africa. But he asked: “Tell me exactly what your anxiety is about. People come. People go. People leave. The water ebbs, the water flows, the water ebbs. What’s so unusual about this?” He was my old man of the sea. A very precious human being, a mischievous man with a sense of humour – a naughty man, but a most delightful human being.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Ginwala</strong>: Since China has been mentioned in this way, also as an ebb and flow – there is a lot of anxiety in this part of the world and a lot of ignorance around China and Chinese presences in the plural sense in the Afro-Asian seas, in the Swahili seas. There are different striking ways in which you have both also chronicled Chinese presences.</p>
            <p><strong>Njenga Karugia</strong>: There has been a heated debate in Germany about China and Chinese interests at the Hamburg port. Cosco, one of the largest harbour operators, has been allowed by the German government to take over 24.9% of the Hamburg harbour – this is nothing new, but we have seen a new jurisprudence coming up within the European Union and it is the idea of screening Chinese investments, especially now that China has interests across the ports in Europe. Why do I start with that? China of course is investing in Germany. And we know that Germany trades heavily with China: 30% of goods that are processed at the Hamburg harbour are either coming in from China or leaving for China. One of the greatest gifts that I would say as a Kenyan German global citizen is the fact that we have been gifted by scientists who demilitarised the Internet as a military technology and made it available for everyone. It is the idea of democratisation of knowledge and the idea that I can sit in my little office in Berlin and look at data from across the world. I’m able to watch the trade between Germany and China. I’m able to watch the trade between the US and China. There is no American economy and there is no Chinese economy. There is the Amerochina economy. When Africa trades with China everybody has something to say about that trade. The continent of Africa has opportunity for everybody to trade with Africa. What people are looking for, at least the farmers and those who are producing, is a political economy of dignity: People want to sell and they want to receive fair prices for their goods. They do not want gifts. It is ignorant that people don’t take a moment to reflect. Western media will frame Africa-China relations using the term “colonialism”. There is no African who wakes up in the morning and sits under a tree and looks at the fluctuating colonialisms. People want to do business. People are busy producing, selling, looking for markets and so on. Those societies that are reflecting Africa in terms of colonialism are not reflecting themselves. And the media in terms of colonialism? They call their relation “trade”.</p>
            <p><strong>Adhiambo Owuor</strong>: At the heart of it is the whining. The whining comes from the West. There are incredible new spaces of opportunities that have emerged because of the return of old relationships – and I emphasise the fact that it’s old relationships. At the heart of “The China sky is falling on African heads” is another issue. There’s something deeper beneath that surface.</p>
            <p><strong>Ginwala</strong>: Maybe this is a good moment to turn this more conversational. Is there anything someone in the audience would like to share or bring up?</p>
            <p><strong>Audience member 1</strong>: I have a question regarding what we are doing with these stories. I come from southern India, mostly the coastal regions, and I’ve been living here for the last ten years or so. What I’m very curious about is how are we engaging with these stories and with such discourses on our shores.</p>
            <p><strong>Adhiambo Owuor</strong>: We were doing this already thirty years ago. It’s only that the world has caught up with us right now. So much of the work had already been done by some of the incredible scholars like Professor Abdul Sheriff or the late Taqī ad-Dīn an-Nabhānī. That’s part of the reason why people like me don’t consider themselves an academic. I’ve moved into this area so long ago the West had receded from my imagination when the ocean found me. I understood that I too, am a descendant of immense ancient legacies and I was very embarrassed that I had not been aware of it yet.</p>
            <p><strong>Ginwala</strong>: I think the question is very crucial. As we sit in Berlin, a place that’s saturated with artistic presence and contributions, it was really important to Bonaventure and me that the project didn’t start in Germany. We are doing a residency in Pakistan, in Lyari, where there is an Afro-Asian community. The Siddis are there and the Baloch people and their own inheritances of the sea. It was also important to us for the project to land in South Africa. I’ve also done work in Sri Lanka connecting to maritime histories and histories of war. It seems it’s up to us to recirculate and to index the scholarship that has already taken place in the past.</p>
            <p><strong>Adhiambo Owuor</strong>: And to take the steps to visiting and entering into these worlds, even just by showing up. It’s such an incredible time with the whole world moving, turning its gaze into those oceans that some people call “Indian” right now. In so many ways it is in the centre of the future – these immense opportunities for everyone. No one is left out. I just want everyone else to know that. These immense opportunities for recovery, for discovery and for imagining new ways.</p>
            <p><strong>Njenga Karugia</strong>: I’m coming from memory studies and I am looking at how memories are produced and what these memories are used for but also asking a third and important question: How can we do memory better? When I’m in these spaces and I visit museums and memory spaces, and especially when I was doing the documentary film Afrasian Memories in East Africa together with Ramadhan Khamis, we engaged the people who are responsible in doing the memory. I am very interested in the idea of cosmopolitanism and representation of cosmopolitan within cosmopolitan spaces. What kind of stories are we then telling? What kind of representation are we doing? These spaces and places have their heroes and their poetry and music – what local stories can we connect within all these translocalities?</p>
            <p><strong>Audience member 2</strong>: Yvonne, I was thinking of what you said about the evacuation of agency and what must be then done to imagine a kind of counterforce to it. Ocean currents today are a measure of time. Some last a few seconds and then some are thousands of years old as well. There is a suboceanic force. What is a way to rewild instead of replace agency? Can the idea of brutality of the ocean itself be thought of as some mode of sensing that agency as well? I am thinking about the implosion of the submersible Titan in June 2023 for example.</p>
            <p><strong>Adhiambo Owuor</strong>: Beyond brutality, I would imagine reading it as a reminder of the forces that despite our human hubris, actually take precedent over our illusions and delusions of dominance. As much as we imagine we can, we will not dominate the oceans. I hope that we will be there to receive the waves, to open our senses, to pick up the stories that are there. There are enough of us to pick a story strand to tell, to paint, to sing, to restore. There is an act of recovery, of rebuilding the ruins of our imagination of stories. And in a way, it’s also restoring and restorying the ocean. I’m curious – those who are of German origin: Do you consider yourself a Hanseatic civilisation? Are you also an oceanic civilisation? What’s the relationship with the sea?</p>
            <p><strong>Audience member 3</strong>: There is a huge limestone quarry close to Berlin. That limestone quarry consists of calcium, of shells – it’s the sea that was here millions and millions of years ago. We are walking on it and are surrounded by it every day. We can tune into the stories of that old sea that was here. I personally have no relationship with the Hanseatic history of the sea but learning about that limestone quarry touched me a lot.</p>
            <p><strong>Audience member 4</strong>: When we’re talking about restoring, I feel that we need to have more conversations and acknowledge the commonality. I think there’s been a lot of dividing – the after effect of colonialism. We are not aware of what is common between us. We are more aware of the differences and I think we can decolonise in a way, if we bring out what is common.</p>
            <p><strong>Ginwala</strong>: I just can’t help but come back to this question of complicating the idea of Kenya, especially also Swahili, Kiswahili politics in relation to language politics. I am thinking about somebody like Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o and the question whether the language you write in can put you into prison or not<sup class="footNote" id="fn8">8</sup>. What are the complexities and complications also in the language legacy as you see it today?</p>
            <p><strong>Njenga Karugia</strong>: In “Globalectics: Theory and the Politics of Knowing”, Ngũgĩ talks about globalectical imagination. It is the idea that a story from Pakistan, if it is translated, can speak to you.</p>
            <p><strong>Adhiambo Owuor</strong>: Beyond Ngũgĩ there is a contemporary space – and it does not take away from Ngũgĩ – that some of us call the promiscuity of languages. Swahili itself is not just a language. It becomes a world and an absorbent substance that takes whatever it needs to be what it wants to be. Locating ourselves in the water and looking at the land, there is this fluidity: The water is fluid, it is informed by the winds and the winds bring whatever they need to bring into the space. A new song is always born when the winds show up. I think of language as an entity, an organic form, a container of words. We cannot be limited by the constraints of what we think language is. Language to live must evolve. Language to live must be able to change.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>By the time the nakhoda (dhow captain) Mansur Al-Khariji sat down and
            penned the colophon to his manuscript in March 1945, he had already been
            sailing for more than forty years and taking notes for nearly as long.
            His first voyage, he wrote, was with his older brother ‘Ali in 1895;
            seven years later he would begin learning how to captain his own vessel.
            Decades after Al-Khariji’s death, a Kuwaiti research center would
            publish his notebook as a navigational guide with the rather unwieldy
            title Al-Qawā‘id wa Al-Mayl wa Al-Natija fi ‘Ilm Al-Biḥār [The
            Principles and Declinations and Almanac in the Science of the Seas]
            which Al-Khariji himself appended to the book’s inside cover page. But
            there was little to suggest that there was a coherent project behind the
            book itself: he cobbled together the different principles of navigation
            and data that one might find in other navigational manuals, but much of
            it consisted of what appeared to be notes to himself. Rather than a
            coherent treatise on navigation, Al-Khariji’s writing more closely
            resembles a notebook in which he jotted down various principles of
            navigation and their accompanying maxims, but also different rules,
            formularies, observations, poetry, and more. The only threads that ran
            through the different entries in the book were Al-Khariji himself, of
            course, and the fact that all of these were collected on his dhow as he
            sailed around the Western Indian Ocean.</p>
            <p>A ship captain’s notebook may seem like an unlikely place from which
            to reflect on how we write history—but on the deck of a dhow, we might
            read things a little differently. Because for nakhodas like Al-Khariji,
            the world looked different than what it does when we stare at it on a
            map. Where we see landmasses separated (or connected) by bodies of
            water, they saw seas and oceans ringed by coasts: waterways and sea
            lanes that bled into one another, and an oceanic world that washed up
            onto the shores of the Arabian Peninsula, Africa, and India. From the
            deck of the dhow, then, what historians understand to be the “Middle
            East” or “Arabia” appeared to wash into the waters of their more
            immediate milieu, the Arabian Sea.</p>
            <p>For Al-Khariji, the Arabian Sea was more than just a scholarly
            construct; it was the world in which he lived. From the turn of the
            century onward, he spent most of his time at sea, shuttling back and
            forth between the Gulf, South Asia, the Southern Red Sea, and East
            Africa. His notebook reflected this broad geography, but so too did his
            dhow: nakhodas like him took on sailors from Yemen, and saw themselves
            as part of a broader community of Arab mariners. It is through
            Al-Khariji, his dhow, and these mariners more generally that we can
            begin to think about the watery contours of the Arabian Peninsula. The
            promise of the dhow lies in its ability to force us to come to terms
            with how one writes history such that the land appears only in our
            peripheral vision.</p>
            <p>Among the emirates and shaikhdoms of the Gulf, land and sea blurred
            together. The wealth and income they relied on were spread out across
            the Indian Ocean littoral: the government budget in Muscat depended on
            remittances and wealth in Zanzibar; the physical and financial capital
            of economic actors in Kuwait circulated between Southern Iraq, Persia,
            India, and East Africa much more than they did inland; and the merchant
            classes of Aden relied heavily on a broad infrastructure of law,
            industry, and government that linked them directly to Bombay. The
            circulation of people, goods, and other “things” on board dhows loosens
            our grip on historical processes. It destabilizes our sense of place,
            challenging our terrestrially-grounded notions of what state, law,
            economy, and even society might look like, forcing us to grapple instead
            with how those categories might operate when spread over broad
            distances. Contending with, tapping into, and otherwise managing the
            movement of goods, people, and wealth around the Indian Ocean was thus
            central, rather than incidental, to the processes that constituted
            state, society, and economy in the region.<sup class="footNote" id="fn9">9</sup></a></p>
            <p>I want to suggest that we take Al-Khariji’s notebook as a provocation
            to think more oceanically. Rather than take stable, grounded categories
            as our point of departure, the notebook asks us to think about the
            sinews of circulation and connection across the Indian Ocean—to think
            about movement itself, but also the ideas and infrastructures that make
            that movement possible. Reading Al-Khariji’s notebook in this way is not
            nearly as much of an imaginative departure as it might initially appear
            to be: the thrust of the notebook involves the routes that he
            constructed and traversed, and the circulation of goods, people, and
            capital that he engaged in. By thinking alongside Al-Khariji, we can
            take these circulations and connections as routes out of the Arabian
            Peninsular container that the Red Sea and Gulf have been limited to and
            instead open them up to the broader horizons of the Arabian Sea. For
            like other nakhodas, Al-Khariji was actively tracing out the connected
            worlds that dhows moved through, and the routes and circuits of capital
            and law that animated them. His notebook is thus as much of an
            invitation to think more capaciously about Arabia’s oceanic history as
            it is a practical guide for navigating the seascape and maritime
            economy.</p>
            <h3 id="environment-and-epistemology">Environment and Epistemology</h3>
            <p>It might come as no surprise that the bulk of Al-Khariji’s notebook
            deals with the nuts and bolts of navigation on board a dhow; that was
            the work he did, after all. Although some of this involves instructions
            for sailing into and out of specific ports and along particular coasts
            (a topic I discuss in greater detail below) most of it involves the
            abstract principles that facilitated wayfinding by the nakhoda. In the
            notebook, he included principles for determining latitude through
            measurement of the sun, and a series of mathematical principles for
            deriving longitude from a combination of solar declination and
            latitude—highly-technical discussions that would normally not be of
            interest to anyone but the most committed of historians of the
            navigational sciences.</p>
            <p><img class="img-text" src="imgs/arabia-at-sea/arabia-at-sea4.jpg" /></p>
            <h4
            id="principles-for-wayfinding-in-al-kharijis-al-qawāid-wal-mīl-source-al-failakawi-collection-kuwait">Principles
            for Wayfinding in Al-Khariji’s <em>Al-Qawā‘id Wal-Mīl<br />
            </em>(Source: Al-Failakawi Collection, Kuwait)</h4>
            <p>And yet, Al-Khariji’s notes on wayfinding immediately challenge the
            historian to think about the ways in which human actors from around the
            Arabian coasts drew on their natural environment to forge routes across
            the water. For the Indian Ocean historian, this is in many ways an old
            story. The pioneering works of Indian Ocean history all began with an
            explication of the monsoon winds and the patterned movement around the
            water that they helped shape; perhaps just as many Indian Ocean history
            undergraduate courses begin in a similar fashion. The monsoon winds are,
            in many ways, the sine qua non of circulation in the Indian Ocean world:
            they constitute the essence of how historians have understood movement
            and connection in the region, and what lends the region its coherence.
            In many ways, it is what makes the region “oceanic” but also what makes
            it distinctly “Indian.” For those working on trade and empire in the
            region, the environment has thus long been part of the story of the
            Indian Ocean world—so much so that the monsoons have become an abused
            metaphor for virtually every remotely oceanic phenomenon there can
            be.</p>
            <p>But Al-Khariji’s writings remind us that the natural environment was
            not simply a backdrop, shaping human behavior but never shaped by it.
            Actors around the Indian Ocean world actively intervened in their
            environment as they made their way across the ocean. They actively
            thought about the wind, yes, but also the stars, the sun, and the water
            itself, and devised ways to recombine those elements into
            epistemological frameworks that allowed them to determine where they
            were and where they might be going. The act of movement thus involved a
            high degree of interaction (and indeed, entanglement) with the natural
            environment. It required nakhodas and other wayfinders to take the
            natural world and abstract from it, so as to facilitate the circulations
            from which they drew their livelihoods.</p>
            <p>Al-Khariji was hardly alone in this endeavor. Nakhodas from around
            the Gulf produced texts similar to his: manuals aimed at guiding their
            peers through the maritime environment of the Indian Ocean, virtually
            all of which were even more structured and intentional than
            Al-Khariji’s. Among the authors of texts like these, perhaps none was as
            prolific or revered as the nakhoda ‘Isa Al-Qitami. Born in 1870, he was
            a renowned Kuwaiti captain and navigator: historians and other nakhodas
            alike refer to him as “al-rubban al-awwal,” the first pilot. By the
            early 1920s, Al-Qitami had authored three texts, the first and most
            popular being the Dalil Al-Muḥtar fi ‘Ilm Al-Biḥar [The Perplexed’s
            Guide to the Science of the Seas], a nautical manual that combined the
            principles of navigation with practical directions for sailing around
            the coasts the western Indian Ocean, which he first published in 1916.
            Shortly after writing the Dalil, he published Al-Mukhtaṣar Al-Khaṣ
            Lil-Musafir Wal-Tajir Wal-Ghawwaṣ [The Summary Specific to the Traveler,
            the Merchant, and the Diver], a shorter manual aimed at guiding nakhodas
            around the coasts and pearl banks of the Persian Gulf. And in 1924 he
            published Al-Khaliṣ Min Kulli ‘Ayb fī Waḍ‘ Al-Jayb [The Blemish-Free in
            the Situation of the Pocket], a manual to assist in the standardization
            of the weight and value of pearls, facilitating their movement from one
            marketplace to another.<sup class="footNote" id="fn10">10</sup></p>

            <p>If Al-Qitami’s texts give a good sense of the range of texts that
            nakhodas produced on how to recombine the elements of the natural world
            to facilitate the movement of people and goods, he was not the only one.
            There were many others like him, though few were quite as active. In
            1933 his contemporaries, the Kuwaiti nakhodas Mohammed bin ‘Asfour and
            Hussain bin ‘Abdulrahman Al-‘As‘ousi, published Al-Natija Al-Kuwaitiyya,
            an almanac that mixes navigational principles with mathematical tables
            for determining date and time. And as late as 1956, the Suri nakhoda
            Nasser Al-Khaduri penned the manual Ma‘dan Al-Asrar fi ‘Ilm Al-Biḥar
            [The Mine of Secrets in the Science of the Seas] as a corrective to
            Al-Qitami’s manual.<sup class="footNote" id="fn11">11</sup> Read together, we might see these
            texts as part of a trans-oceanic maritime print culture, a world of
            books that traveled back and forth across the ocean, prompting a
            circulation of ideas and skills that were at least as important as the
            trade in goods. The circulation of these texts on the decks of
            dhows—their movement from the hands of one nakhoda to
            another—contributed to the spread of particular forms of navigational
            practice around the Arab maritime communities of the Indian Ocean, as
            mobile captains and mariners moved from one port city to another. These
            writings thus formed the vectors through which navigational knowledge
            and practice was disseminated through the Indian Ocean world; they
            formed a crucial part of the history of oceanic circulation that drew
            the Arabian Peninsula into its sea.</p>
            <p>Texts like these imagined a broad audience of Arab mariners—none more
            self-consciously than Al-Qitami, whose Dalīl addressed “our Arab
            seafaring brothers.” To meet their expectations, he wrote in a nautical
            colloquial that, according to the Dalil’s editor, was to appeal to
            mariners, for “among those who work on sailing voyages, some are
            illiterate and cannot read and write, and they will not benefit from it
            unless it was written in the common dialect.”<sup class="footNote" id="fn8">12</sup>
            In his Mukhtaṣar, Al-Qitami makes this clearer: he explains that
            although grammarians might find fault in the language he uses in the
            text, “it will suffice to communicate the book, because all of them
            [i.e. practitioners] will have come upon this language in their comings
            and goings.”<sup class="footNote" id="fn13">13</sup> Al-Qitami thus stretched the
            contours of Arabic writing—and with it, the Arab world—into the
            circulating dhows and mariners that made up his “Arab seafaring
            brothers.” His writing suggests the possibility of a broader society of
            Arabs at sea, ones who had their own lexicons, signs, and histories as
            well.</p>
            <p>It is thus perhaps unsurprising that among Al-Khariji’s notes lies an
            explicit reference to the writings of the fifteenth-century Arab
            navigator Ahmad Ibn Majid, a looming figure in Indian Ocean history and
            the author of the navigational treatise Kitab Al-Fawa’id, which is today
            considered a pillar of the Arab nautical canon. In a section entitled
            “The Sayings of Ibn Majid, the Shaikh of the Science of the Seas,” he
            quotes the navigator’s admonitions to nakhodas to keep watch at night
            and to take responsibility for the ship more generally, but also his
            advice on when to take solar bearings. More than 400 years stood between
            the two navigators, and yet Ibn Majid remained, both for Al-Khariji and
            for many other nakhodas who found in the famous navigator’s treatise
            echoes of issues they continued to confront. The appearance of the
            legendary navigator illustrates how, on the deck of the dhow, the
            epistemologies of the past poured into those of the present, tying the
            Arab seafarers of previous centuries into the circulations of the
            nakhodas of the twentieth-century Arabian Sea.</p>

            <h3 id="infrastructures-of-circulation">Infrastructures of
            Circulation</h3>
            <p>Of course, not all of Al-Khariji’s notes were on the principles of
            navigation. Littered throughout the manuscript, and in no particular
            order, were principles of a very different sort: legal and financial.
            Much like his discussion of the principles of navigation, these were
            also intimately tied into the act of circulation. Law and finance formed
            the infrastructure of circulation in the Indian Ocean, animating the act
            of crossing and forging pathways through the regional commercial arena.
            And like matters of navigation, these fell directly within the scope of
            the nakhoda’s work: it was his responsibility to ensure that the books
            were in order, that sailors were paid, and that the business of the
            voyage was on a sound footing. It is thus wholly sensible that
            Al-Khariji would place discussions of money and law alongside wind,
            water, sun, and stars.</p>
            <p>It is roughly a quarter of the way into his notebook that Al-Khariji
            enters into his brief digression into the principles of profit-sharing
            on a dhow voyage, taking for his example a sailing season that he
            identifies as having taken place in 1941 (although his discussion seems
            largely hypothetical). Over the course of four manuscript pages, he
            walks his reader through the intricate mathematics involved in
            determining the number of shares on that voyage and their division
            between the shipowner and the crew—and within each, he outlines the
            sub-divisions of shares for the nakhoda, his mates, and ordinary
            sailors, and in a number of different scenarios. His instructions would
            have been immediately legible to nakhodas in both the Gulf and Red Sea,
            where the basic principles underlying the profit-sharing regime on board
            dhows were the same.<sup class="footNote" id="fn14">14</sup></p>

            </em>(Source: Al-Failakawi Collection, Kuwait)</h4>
            <p>Although Al-Khariji supplied only the principles for the division of
            profits at the end of a sailing season, his schema rested on a more
            expansive financial system that intertwined the littoral economies of
            the Arabian Peninsula with those of the Western Indian Ocean more
            broadly. Profit-sharing regimes like these gave teeth to the circulation
            of capital around the Arabian Sea and its transformation from one form
            to another as the dhow and its mariners traveled around the ocean’s
            littoral. Arrangements like this were necessary given the variety of
            goods that dhows moved from one season to another. Dhows from Basra
            would have to make their way to markets around the Western Indian Ocean,
            where profits would be plunged into sacks of rice, flour, and other dry
            goods, scores of timber and mangrove poles, which would then be sold in
            different markets, with proceeds going to different combinations of
            merchants, nakhodas, mariners, and shipowners, all of whom had accrued
            varying amounts of debt along the way. The date circuit thus forged the
            pathways through which other goods and forms of capital could travel,
            both in space and through account ledgers. And the profit-sharing
            system, based as it was in the net proceeds of the entire season rather
            than individual rights to single transactions, was supple enough to bear
            it all.</p>
            <p>As any nakhoda would have known, though, even the most minute
            arrangements for profit-sharing were only as good as the regimes of law
            that they were anchored in. Financial regimes around the world rest on
            different forms of legal security, and the dhow economies of the Western
            Indian Ocean were no different. Virtually every one of the ties that
            bound nakhodas, mariners, ship-owners, and merchants together expressed
            itself in a legal obligation, in a written legal and financial
            instrument that the dhow generated in its wake. Al-Khariji understood
            this well, and knew the importance of getting the form of the instrument
            right: among his notes were formulas for various legal instruments,
            including acknowledgments of debt, safe-conduct passes, and legal
            requests for death certificates from different authorities. Together,
            legal forms like these constituted artifacts of a legal infrastructure
            that underpinned the oceanic circulations that nakhodas engaged in. They
            helped infuse certainty and regularity in a highly uncertain enterprise,
            and coordinated expectations and action between far-flung actors. If the
            coastal economies of the Arabian Peninsula were connected to those of
            the Western Indian Ocean littoral, legal instruments like this formed
            the sinews of those connections.<sup class="footNote" id="fn15">15</sup></p>
            <p>Read this way, Al-Khariji’s notes on law and finance suggest yet
            another route away from the land-locked epistemologies that had long
            constrained thinking on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. These were once
            institutions and practices that we understood as being mostly local in
            nature, the sort that actors developed to give shape to the maritime
            economies of the Arab coasts, and not much more. However, once we open
            up their vistas to include South Asia and East Africa, we can begin to
            see how they formed an infrastructure that facilitates the circulation
            of goods, people, and capital around the Western Indian Ocean more
            broadly. Through the different pieces of paper they mobilized, nakhodas
            like Al-Khariji forged the contours of a maritime commercial arena,
            weaving the economies of coastal Arabia more deeply into those of India
            and the East African coast. For the inhabitants of the world of dhows,
            law was not the terrestrial phenomenon we have long understood it to be.
            Rather, law as a historical phenomenon was thoroughly submerged in salty
            water, soaking through the pieces of paper that nakhodas, mariners, and
            even pirates wielded as they crossed the waters of the Arabian Sea. <sup class="footNote" id="fn16">16</sup></p>
            <p>At the same time, these circulating forms have to be read as
            expressions of a much deeper Islamic legal epistemology, one that bound
            the history of the Arabian Peninsula to legal communities around the
            Indian Ocean world. They drew on a long history of Islamic jurisprudence
            and writings on obligations—or, more accurately, they excerpted,
            paraphrased, and otherwise borrowed from them in order to forge the
            legal contours of their own world-economies. As they circulated around
            the ocean’s shores, these legal discourses, anchored in texts and
            embodied in legal scholars traveling on dhows, formed a
            counter-narrative to that of imperial law. And as they took shape in
            different paper obligations, they rendered that counter-narrative
            portable.</p>
            <h3 id="imperial-entanglements">Imperial Entanglements</h3>
            <p>Of course, imperial politics were never too far from the minds of
            nakhodas like Al-Khariji. If their writings point to a narrative of
            connection, circulation, and history beyond empire, they could never
            escape it entirely. As frequent visitors to the port cities of South
            Asia and East Africa at the height of imperial expansion in the Indian
            Ocean, they were keenly aware of the ways in which empires attempted to
            impose themselves onto the coasts of the Arabian Peninsula and across
            the high seas. And for the mobile mariners of the twentieth-century
            Indian Ocean, the British Empire was the most dominant imperial
            presence, but was certainly not the only one—and, more than that, only
            the latest in a long chain of empires.</p>
            <p>Al-Khariji had a keen eye for how the empire had remade the world
            around the dhow. At a few points in his manuscript, he made note of
            different political events that he had witnessed or heard about. The
            first such note appears roughly halfway through the notebook, sandwiched
            between a template for a debt obligation and a note on how to convert
            between different units of weight measurement. In it, he writes that on
            the 17th of Dhu Al-Hijja 1332 A.H. (that is, November 6,
            1914) he was loading dates in the town of Al-Qasba, on the Shatt
            Al-‘Arab waterway in southern Iraq, when “the English entered Al-Faw,”
            the town at the mouth of the Shatt, where the Ottoman customs house
            stood. “On the second day,” he continued, “their ships entered into the
            creek, and a fierce battle took place, lasting an hour and a half.” He
            followed it with a different note, this one from February 1936, where on
            the island of Zanzibar “there was a battle between the English
            Christians and the Arabs of Oman” which left several people dead or
            injured on both sides, along with other onlookers. The cause, he wrote,
            “was the coconut copra”—the dried flesh of the coconut fruit, which
            formed one of the island’s exports.</p>

            Notes on Political Events in <em>Al-Qawā‘id Wal-Mīl<br />
            </em>(Source: Al-Failakawi Collection, Kuwait)</h4>
            <p>The two notes, separated in both time and space, highlight different
            moments in the history of British imperialism in the Western Indian
            Ocean. The first was a clear reference to the beginnings of the
            Mesopotamia campaign of World War One, which ultimately led to the
            establishment of a British mandate in Iraq during the 1920s. The second
            was a much lesser known event: a riot that took place in the Zanzibar
            countryside over rising British regulations on the sale of copra—a
            matter that would hardly make it into the annals of the history of
            Zanzibar itself, let alone the world. Taken together, the two events
            plot out different moments in the history of Arab encounters with empire
            in the twentieth century: the first with imperial battleships, and the
            second with imperial regulations. But read alongside a third note, the
            picture emerges more clearly. In a later inscription, Al-Khariji very
            briefly mentions that in 1343 A.H. (1924/5) Reza Shah, the Pahlavi ruler
            of Iran, took over the town of Mohammerah (a major port of call for
            dhows visiting the Shatt Al-‘Arab) “and what remained of the possessions
            of the ruler Shaikh Khaz‘al, the son of Shaikh Jaber,” the town’s
            chief.</p>
            <p>The note on Reza Shah, unrelated to the history of encounters with
            Europeans, casts a different light on Al-Khariji’s observations as a
            whole. Read differently, what Al-Khariji was drawing attention to were
            the ways in which the political shape of the Arab world of the Indian
            Ocean was slowly being transformed. His notes alluded to a littoral
            geography that had largely been under the control of Arabs—the
            agricultural villages and hamlets along the Shatt Al-‘Arab waterway, the
            shaikhdom of Mohammerah (which comprised both Arabs and Persians, but
            was known to many as ‘Arabistan), and the Arab-headed Sultanate of
            Zanzibar—that over the twentieth century had increasingly fallen under
            the control of more distant rulers. There were others like them, too,
            around the Arabian Peninsula; most prominently Aden and the neighboring
            island of Perim, which during the 19<sup>th</sup> and
            early-20<sup>th</sup> centuries fell under administrative jurisdiction
            of the Bombay Presidency.<sup class="footNote" id="fn17">17</sup></p>
            <p>This political transformation makes itself visible in Al-Khariji’s
            drawings, roughly a dozen of which are scattered around his notebook.
            All were of different coastlines and port cityscapes around the Gulf,
            Red Sea, South Asia, and East Africa. None of this was unusual;
            landmarks like mountains or other unique geological features helped
            orient them as they made their way along the coasts of the Western
            Indian Ocean, and navigational guides often included at least rough
            drawings of them. And many of Al-Khariji’s drawings were like those of
            his peers: they included hillsides, rough drawings of coastlines, and
            features like trees and ships. In some of his drawings, there was little
            (if any) direct imperial presence. He highlighted mosques, temples,
            lighthouses, and other distinct features, but nothing with any strong
            imperial connotations.</p>

            drawings of Merca, Mukalla, and Ras Faylak in <em>Al-Qawā‘id

            <p>In other drawings, though, the imperial presence is much more
            visible. His drawing of Mangalore, for example, features a large Union
            Jack right at its center; another drawing of Perim Island includes two
            smaller British flags, while a drawing of the port city of Merca in
            Somalia includes one Italian tricolor. Had he included drawings of Obock
            or Djibouti, they would have doubtless included French flags as well.
            Beyond these obvious signs were more subtle indicators: signs of
            industrial activity along the waterfront, or systems of lighthouses and
            buoys for regulating movement across particular creeks and headlands,
            for example. As the dhows moved around the Western Indian Ocean, then,
            they had to navigate the markings of political authority that different
            imperial projects left along the coast. Empire was thus part of the Arab
            nakhodas seascape; it etched itself onto the coastlines that captains
            like Al-Khariji saw as they looked out from the decks of their dhows and
            onto the port cityscapes that approached them from their bow. Empires
            did not just map themselves onto old geographies; they created new ones,
            and with them new pathways of circulation.</p>
            <p>It was from those port cities that these empires attempted to project
            themselves beyond the coast and onto the high seas. By the mid-1860s,
            the British had established Vice-Admiralty Courts in Bombay, Aden, and
            Zanzibar, routing a regular convoy of naval ships around the Western
            Indian Ocean in attempts to intercept dhows suspected of involvement in
            the slave trade.<sup class="footNote" id="fn18">18</sup> Al-Khariji also included templates
            for safe-conduct passes, it was in part because of the frequent
            encounters between dhows like his and naval vessels; in 1868 nakhodas
            were already producing passes like these in an effort to maneuver around
            the British surveillance regime. Al-Khariji would have known, too, that
            there were other papers he could obtain that would produce different
            results. Alongside the British, after all, were the French and the
            Italians, all of whom were furnishing their own safe-conduct passes from
            ports they controlled. The Arabian Sea thus teemed with different
            political authorities, all of whom intervened in the geographies of
            circulation and tried to determine the terms on which it could happen—to
            delineate the “right” forms of circulation from the “wrong” ones.<sup class="footNote" id="fn19">19</sup> The savvy nakhoda had to know how
            to navigate across more than one imperial horizon at a time.</p>
            <p>But the history of the Arabian Sea is not just one that pits plucky
            Arab mariners against the forces of European empire. As tidy as it might
            be to schematically separate the two from one another, the evidence
            immediately suggests a history of deeper entanglement. Read from the
            dhow, the horizons of the nakhodas and of the British officials they
            came into contact with were closely bound up in one another. Al-Khariji
            and his fellow Arab nakhodas frequently drew on British nautical
            technologies—admiralty maps, nautical almanacs, and the like—as they
            plotted their routes around the Western Indian Ocean. His own notebook
            attests to as much: Al-Khariji included a discussion of how nakhodas
            converted dates from the Nawruz calendar (which they routinely used to
            track the passage of time) to the “Frankish” (i.e. Gregorian) calendar
            on which the almanacs he relied upon were based.</p>
            <p>European officials, too, exerted enormous efforts to draw on the
            nautical expertise of dhow captains. The story of the Indian Ocean
            navigator who helped Vasco da Gama cross the Arabian Sea (erroneously
            thought to be Ahmad Ibn Majid) is by now well-known. Less familiar are
            the publications that European officials produced on Arab navigational
            techniques, and the degree to which they drew on nakhodas’ knowledge to
            produce texts like the Sailing Directions for the Red Sea and Gulf of
            Aden and the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman, and Central Arabia.
            Imperial practices of knowing and mapping thus rested on a body of
            locals and wanderers, natives whose expansive movements and networks fed
            imperial officials with the information they needed to make sense of the
            Indian Ocean world.<sup class="footNote" id="fn20">20</sup></p>
            <p>Thus, even as the circulations that Arab nakhodas thought about and
            engaged in forged routes that take historians beyond the imperial
            connections that they have so thoroughly relied upon in writing oceanic
            history, they were invariably bound up in them. And however they might
            have been classified, the circuits of people, goods, texts, and ideas
            that dhows traced out between the Arabian Peninsula, South Asia, and
            East Africa, all pulsed through imperial arteries. Meanwhile, the
            pathways of imperial expansion mapped themselves onto the movements of
            dhows and the circulations they animated. As dhows and British ships
            made their way around the Indian Ocean, then, their epistemological
            horizons were more deeply entangled in one another than either would
            have been ready to acknowledge.</p>
            <h3 id="unmooring-arabian-history">Unmooring Arabian History</h3>
            <p>There are many reasons why historians might have passed over
            Al-Khariji’s notebook and the broader constellation of texts and
            practices that generated it. Read from the land, few of these texts make
            very much sense: they either come across as excessively technical or
            esoteric, and in all cases seem peripheral to the individuals,
            institutions, and processes that Middle East historians have been
            interested in. Even historians of the Gulf and Red Sea have only noted
            them in passing, as they appear at first blush to offer very little
            insight into the histories of those areas as well. However, this is more
            of an issue of perspective than it is content, of which the texts have
            plenty.</p>
            <p>Read from the sea—from the deck of the dhow—instead of the land,
            these writings open up a window into a whole world of material
            circulation and the intellectual histories that animated it.
            Circulation, these texts make clear, was not just about goods or even
            people, but about the full range of social, political, and cultural
            behaviors entangled in the movement of goods, people, and capital around
            a far-flung arena.<sup class="footNote" id="fn21">21</sup> As an historical phenomenon, it
            offers historians a lens through which to see how areas were intertwined
            with one another, and how different realms of life could play out over
            broad distances. Texts like Al-Kharijis—and more importantly, the ideas
            within them—formed the sinews of circulation, and helped forge its
            pathways.</p>
            <p>For the historian of the Arabian Peninsula, the move to the Arabian
            Sea, then, is much more than a shift to a maritime perspective.
            Thinking, reading, and writing oceanically allows us to move beyond
            national and terrestrial paradigms for writing “Middle Eastern” history,
            and to then think about the connections, circulations, and entanglements
            that make up maritime Arabia. And although the promise of oceanic
            history has long been realized, the project that motivates its writing
            is still not over. There is still a need to move away from a
            Eurocentrism in writing the history of the Arabian Sea, to ground our
            narratives in the actions and discourses of non-Europeans, and to write
            histories in which the principal actors are not empires (even as they
            spend much of their time thinking through and alongside empires). This
            is precisely where the dhow—as an historical actor, as a metaphor for a
            particular kind of history, and as an epistemology grounded in a set of
            notes—might help us sail.</p>

            <p>Every April, the monsoon winds in the Indian Ocean blow from the southwest, and every November they turn, blowing from the northeast. Seafarers on wooden sailing vessels with lateen sails or dhows have long harnessed these predictable monsoon winds, moving from South Asia and the Arabian peninsula toward the Horn of Africa and the Swahili coast with the northeast monsoon, and returning with the onset of the southwest monsoon. The monsoon has been central to drawing the Indian Ocean littoral into a transregional arena over the longue duree (Alpers 2013; Amrith 2016; Amrith 2018; Chaudhuri 1985; Roy 2012; Sheriff 2010). </p>

            <h4>Fig. 1. A vahan from Kachchh in Mombasa, 2017. Photo by author. </h4>

            <p>Contemporary Kachchhi dhows or <em>vahan</em> are no longer dependent
                on their sails for movement and run instead on diesel engines. In
                official terms, these vahan are known as “mechanized sailing vessels” in
                India. They are primarily built in Gujarat, in port towns along the Gulf
                of Kachchh such as Mandvi and Jam Salaya. This trade functions as an
                economy of arbitrage (Dua 2016; Dua 2019) as dhows go to minor ports,
                especially in times of conflict. They carry goods such as rice,
                livestock, foodstuffs, electronics, medicines, food aid, tires, and even
                cars across ports in India, the Persian Gulf, Yemen, Somalia and Kenya.
                Despite being able to travel without the monsoon winds, most mechanized
                wooden dhows continue to run with the monsoon, the ports of Dubai and
                Sharjah being important transshipment hubs. Rather than moving by dhow
                with the monsoon, however, sailors now fly back and forth from the UAE
                to India on airplanes. Dhow remain docked in ports convenient for
                transshipment in the UAE through much of the year. As sailors depart
                ports in Gujarat, they leave behind women, children, and kin in their
                homes in Jam Salaya and Mandvi, returning to them once a year.</p>
                <p>With the winds then come other tidings: of friends, lovers, children,
                weddings, the settlement of old debts and the negotiation of new ones.
                Every April, women and children in Mandvi and Jam Salaya await the
                return of their male kin, and the possibility of renewing intimacies
                interrupted by seasons of sail. The rhythms of life for seafaring
                communities in western India move with the monsoon winds, the social and
                economic lives of seafarers and their families based on a monsoonal
                temporality and relationality (Mahajan 2020). After all, the merchants,
                and mariners of Kachchh divided the year based on the shifting monsoon
                winds, their accounting practices being based on a seasonal sailing
                calendar. The period of the northeast monsoon is known as
                <em>mausam,</em> and the southwest monsoon was known as <em>aakhar</em>
                (see also Goswami 2016). The monsoon was not only embedded in Indian
                Ocean commercial practices, but movement with the monsoon was also
                instituted by state powers—from the Portuguese, British, and even the
                post-colonial Indian state, which restricted dhow traffic between
                June-September (see Machado 2014). For Kachchhi seafarers then aakhar
                was a period during which most seafarers would return home, while mausam
                referred to the nine months that they were at sea.</p>
                <p>Today, most sailors still fly back home to India during the
                June-September period, or <em>aakhar</em>, and resume work on board
                vessels with the end of the southwest monsoon, or during mausam.
                Although the movement of dhows is no longer determined by the monsoon,
                the old seasonal monsoonal calendar still matters, often in subtle but
                important ways, seasonality shaping quotidian life of seafarers and
                their kin. Contracts for maritime labor on board dhows are dated
                according to this seasonal calendar, and salaries are paid only during
                aakhar. Aakhar thus continues to be a period in which accounts of the
                season are closed, and contracts are renewed. This seasonal sailing
                calendar is part of an historical experience that continues to shape
                prevailing relations of production, even as Kachchhi seafaring
                communities quickly adapt to changing conditions: of climate change,
                weather, labor, capital, markets, governments, and even, family
                obligations. Life in the seafaring towns of Jam Salaya and Mandvi still
                moves with the monsoon.</p>
                <h3>Home Ports, Network Centers: Living Seasonally in Jam Salaya,and
                Mandvi</h3>
                <p>The towns of Jam Salaya and Mandvi on the Gulf of Kachchh are
                “network centres” (Markovits 2000) connected to elsewhere through the
                dhow trade. The seafarers who call these towns home are predominantly
                Muslim, of the Bhadala and Wagher communities, while some Hindu Kharvas
                continue to work alongside them (see also Simpson 2006). Both these
                towns have long histories of a maritime connections, the rhythms of life
                in town inherently seasonal, social life changing with the winds.</p>
                <p>During mausam, the towns are emptied of seafarers who are away at
                sea. For over six months, they live and work onboard vahans, the day
                divided into six-hour shifts, the crew working in different parts of the
                vessel, the sounds of waves, gusts of wind, and the drone of diesel
                engines all turning into an indecipherable roar. It is also incredibly
                lonely; sailors would only see other crew members at mealtimes, and even
                then, what was there to say? These voyages at sea end and began in
                different ports in India, Somalia, Yemen, the UAE, Oman, Kenya. Sailors
                often never leave port in many of these cities due to safety or simply
                because they do not have permission to leave the highly securitized
                ports in which they dock. And so, with the end of the season, sailors
                look forward to returning home to be reunited with the kin they leave
                behind.</p>
                <p>Aakhar is a time of returns. It is when husbands, fathers, and sons
                come home, their friends and loved ones awaiting their arrival. Aakhar
                is spent in the family home, making repairs to both home and vessel,
                while contracts for the next year’s season are drawn up, and old debts
                are settled. It is also a time of intense social activity. This is the
                only time of the year that weddings take place since the menfolk are
                present. Yet, as many women and men in Jam Salaya and Mandvi would
                confess, the intense social activity took an emotional toll, the end of
                aakhar being a relief for many. And so at the end of aakhar when most
                sailors return to work at sea, the women continued to labor at home.</p>
                <p>The video work “From Aakhar to Mausam” focuses on rhythms of life at
                home and at sea. Capturing both, the sounds of waves and water while
                sailors are away at sea and their intense sociality at home, the video
                is made up of ethnographic snapshots, photos, and videos taken in Jam
                Salaya during weddings and Muharram in 2017. Sunni Bhadala and Wagher
                Muslims in Jam Salaya mark Muharram by bringing out taziyas and
                commemorating the sacrifice of Hussain. As is the case with other
                ceremonies in town, local shrines such as Masum Shah and Hasim Shah’s
                dargahs become nodal points in these celebrations, as saints and God are
                the ultimate patrons for these seafaring communities. The video gestures
                to how women at home, and saints, now buried in shrines on land, become
                a religious, affective, and financial mooring for those out at sea.</p>

                    women they leave behind make their labor and life possible. For sailors
                    spending long months at sea, having a wife at home is an economic must.
                    Women, after all, enable men to move. Not only do they do the work of
                    social reproduction and care for those at home, but they also manage
                    finances and are key actors in determining the status of men. Vahans may
                    be offered to women by their families as part of their dowry; these
                    vahans are then run by their husbands, changing the fortunes of the
                    families these women have married into. Women also handled all family
                    finances: remittances, savings, and salaries. Indeed, it is often solely
                    the women who even have bank accounts, the men rarely having a bank
                    account in their own names. In Jam Salaya, it is women who received
                    monthly payments and managed family finances. They would often
                    supplement family income by undertaking their own small businesses:
                    trading in fabric, artificial jewelry, taking in sewing, setting up food
                    stalls, and generally finding ways to stretch household finances. Women
                    were thus key economic actors. They did so not only by managing income,
                    but also by maintaining social relations with patrons, dhow owners, and
                    creating a network that would allow men to move.</p>
                    <p>Dhow labor functions based on patronage. Dhow labor is compensated
                    based on a complex system of minimal salaries per month, tips, and labor
                    paid for loading and unloading cargo. More importantly however, the
                    system of salary payment runs on a seasonal calendar, salaries often
                    only paid as a lump sum at the end of a seasonal contract. Dhow
                    seafarers were often indebted to dhow owners, typically to pay for
                    weddings: their own, or those of their sons, sisters, and daughters that
                    took place only during aakhar. Moreover, given that salaries were often
                    only paid as a lump sum at the end of the year, the crew would often
                    take loans from the dhow owner even before going out to sea. While the
                    lump sum often ensured some savings for the crew member and his family
                    through the year, typically the crew member would end up indebted to the
                    owner and would continue to work for him for the next season, unless
                    another dhow owner was willing to pay off the original debt and contract
                    the sailor (who would be indebted to the new owner). As Hashim, a
                    retired vahan captain or nakhwa in his 60s once told me, “Sometimes we
                    like that salaries are paid at the end of the year—it ensures some
                    savings through the year and this is especially helpful if there is a
                    wedding to plan, or house to build. But then you also realize that you
                    invariably end up taking loans from the vessel owner. You always end up
                    indebted to the owner.” Shabana, his daughter, put it even more
                    succinctly, “Think of it in this way: they become bonded
                    laborers<em>.”</em> Salaries paid at the end of the season (during
                    aakhar) were therefore intricately tied up with cycles of debt and labor
                    recruitment. Cash-strapped <em>khalaasis</em> and their families
                    invariably looked to dhow owners or <em>seths</em> for loans, who in
                    turn, expected sailors to continue to work for them, whether the debt
                    was repaid.</p>
                    <p>In this case, when sailors become indebted to dhow owners, they
                    become not just laborers or debtors but also clients, dhow owners
                    becoming not only creditors/capitalists but also patrons, with a whole
                    other set of duties and obligations. It is through patronage, and not
                    just through debt, that sailors were bound to dhow owners.
                    Anthropologist Jan Bremen has argued that the relationship between
                    patron and client exceeded the debt relationship. He defines patronage
                    as “a pattern of relationships in which members of hierarchically
                    arranged groups possess mutually recognized, not exactly stipulated
                    rights and obligations involving mutual aid and preferential treatment.
                    The bond between patron and client is personal, and is contracted and
                    continued by mutual agreement for an indeterminate time” (Bremen 1974:
                    18). In this understanding of patronage, the servant as a client had
                    certain rights and obligations; his master as patron was expected to be
                    affectionate, generous and promote the interests of his client. The
                    servant, then, was expected to be loyal and respectful, providing not
                    only labor but also serving the interests of his patron. In this
                    conception, while patronage was initiated through debt, the debt was
                    never one that was expected to be paid off. Rather, it was this mutual
                    relation of dependence that was key, coercion coming into pay when the
                    “total care” of patronage fell away.</p>
                    <p>Patronage similarly constitutes the seafaring community, where the
                    relationship of labor and capital between crew and dhow owners is
                    inflected by conceptions of clients and patrons. Class thus emerges
                    through this relationship of patronage, instantiated in the form of
                    debt. This debt, however, presses certain obligations not only upon the
                    debtor but also upon the creditor, who, as a patron, is expected to
                    provide continued lines of credit, protection and support. Yet, like
                    other patronage systems, the creditor did not always expect to repaid
                    the debt in cash, but through the continued labor of the debtor. Within
                    this patronage system that shaped masculine maritime labor across the
                    Indian Ocean, the labor of women who do not move across the sea with
                    them is largely invisible. This gendered form of labor involved
                    maneuvering these systems of patronage in ways that would benefit their
                    households and kin. It was often women who found new patrons/dhow owners
                    for their male kin to work with, it was women who asked dhow owners for
                    credit during the year, and it was often women who ensured that their
                    male kin were paid the salaries owed to them at the end of the sailing
                    season. Although women did not move with men, their labor of being in
                    relation which included their movement between homes, care-work and
                    maintenance of social networks made the movement of men across the ocean
                    possible. Women thus acted not only as care givers in the absence of
                    male kin, but also harnessed their networks that extended from one
                    household to another to shape family fortunes.</p>
                    <p>This gendered labor of being in relation turned women at home into
                    mediators—between homes, between dhow owners and laborers, between
                    interlocutors and anthropologists. The labor of being in relation
                    undertaken by women is essential economically to cultivate, nurture and
                    tend to the relations of patronage that link men to women, sailors to
                    dhow owners. The dhow at sea was thus anchored to the home on land
                    through the labor of women who kept relations with patrons. Yet for dhow
                    owners, sailors and their female kin, the ultimate patron was a
                    non-living being: the Sufi saint.</p>

                    <p>The voyaging dhow, the home, men and women, dhow sailors and dhow
                    owners were all moored to each other but also to the Sufi shrine,
                    especially those who arrived on Gujarat’s shores from other places,
                    often on a dhow. The ultimate patron for seafaring communities was the
                    Sufi saint, a mediator between the human and God. Take for example the
                    Sufi saint Shah Murad Bukhari. Shah Murad Bukhari is the patron-saint of
                    Kachchhi vahan sailors and fishermen of Kharva, Bhadala, and Wagher
                    origin. He arrived in Mundra—an old port city and now home to one of the
                    only ports from where Indian dhows can go out to sea—from Bukhara around
                    1660 A.D. It is said that during the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar, Shah
                    Murad Bukhari was sent to negotiate tax payments from the Rao of Kachchh
                    to the Mughals. Even as the Mughal collector was sleeping, he had a
                    dream in which his bed was sent out to sea, and he was floating in the
                    middle of it. In the dream, Shah Bukhari came to save him. The next day,
                    the tax collector woke up and decided to waive the taxes for that
                    region, indebted to the miracle that Shah Bukhari had performed. After
                    the saint’s passing, women, men, and children travelled to this shrine,
                    worried about the safety of those at sea. They would enter the
                    <em>“Daryai Bari”</em> or the “Window to the Sea” and Shah Bukhari, the
                    Saint of the Sea, would let them know if their loved ones were safe. The
                    window is now boarded up, the saint silent, as WhatsApp carries messages
                    across the sea. Yet, Shah Bukhari is remembered for protecting seafarers
                    and their families. This is especially true in the face of a changing
                    monsoon and inclement weather in the Indian Ocean.</p>

                    <p>The Indian Ocean, as the world’s fastest warming ocean, has seen a
                        rising number of extreme weather events like storms and cyclones. The
                        monsoon, too, is less predictable than it once was, starting later and
                        later each year. Dhow sailors at sea now grapple with unpredictable
                        weather and danger at sea by looking to forms of protection afforded by
                        their ultimate patrons: Sufi saints and God.</p>
                        <p>Take for example Irfan, a dhow captain. On May 25, 2018, he anchored
                        his vahan at the jetty in Salalah in Oman for over week, closely
                        following weather reports that indicated a storm was approaching. Only
                        two days earlier, they heard of the destruction Cyclone Mekunu had
                        caused in Socotra, growing anxious as the cyclone headed their way,
                        gathering strength. Cyclone Mekunu was the most intense tropical cyclone
                        to have hit the Arabian peninsula in recorded history. Irfan and his
                        crew off-loaded all cargo for safekeeping and to prevent the vessel from
                        capsizing. The dhow was securely anchored, all crew members on board. As
                        the storm approached, the sky began to churn, winds moving clockwise
                        with speeds as high as 185 km/h. Safely on board the vessel, Irfan took
                        out a small green flag and tied it to a bannister near the cabin,
                        chanting along with the entire crew “Ya Ghous” calling for the
                        protection of the Sufi saint, Abdul Kadir Gilani, the founder of the
                        Qadriyya tariqa (a Sufi order). The green fabric of the flag was cut
                        from a <em>chadar</em> (a sheet) that had once covered the tomb of Shah
                        Murad Bukhari, and carried his blessings. While men battled the cyclone
                        at sea, women at home rushed to Sufi shrines, praying for the safety of
                        loved ones.</p>
                        <p>When the storm abated, Irfan and his crew found themselves safe, even
                        as seven other Indian dhows sank in the waters that lay beyond Salalah
                        port. Once the sea was calm again, Irfan and his crew continued their
                        voyage, or <em>gos</em>, transporting secondhand cars from Sharjah to
                        Nishtoon in Yemen. Upon completing the voyage back to Sharjah, Irfan
                        returned to Jam Salaya and made a pilgrimage to the dargah of Shah Murad
                        Bukhari, to thank him for keeping him and his crew safe during their
                        voyage. For Irfan and his crew, the tying of the flag marked their
                        faith, and the potential for its fulfillment, Sufi saints making
                        possible the movement of dhows. These days, models of vahans are left at
                        the shrine, as offerings to the saint, a plea for protection.</p>
                        <p>Men at sea are thus dependent on the labor of women, and on the
                        protection of saints. The dhow as an object that’s constantly on the
                        move is moored to the home and the Sufi shrine, objects that do not move
                        but make mobility possible. Sufi shrines, the home, and dhows at sea are
                        bound together through patronage, not only of dhow sailors but also Sufi
                        saints who offer a window to the sea, even for those who remain at
                        home.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>First, it belonged to the djinns. Three unsuspecting friends heard
                their sweet music, drew closer, found a chorus of spirits. A pact was
                made between the djinns and the human interlopers, the latter promising
                to keep this secret music to themselves. On his deathbed, one man shared
                the gift—and so, as the story goes, the unearthly melodies were let
                loose in the world, eventually bellowed from the lungs of pearl divers.
                According to Bahraini folklore, the 19th century Fjiri genre sprung from
                this supernatural encounter.</p>
                <p>Music, like poetry, welcomes porousness. Histories seep between the
                cracks. Across time, influence buoys. The tabla is pounded. A day
                passes. <em>My sadness intensifies / And I abandon sleep</em>. So wrote
                the pioneering Omani poet Ali Bin Abdallah Sawakhroun, otherwise known
                as Ali Al-Somali. Raised on Hadhrami poetry and his mother’s musical
                tastes, Al-Somali would go on to pen poems that could live as songs.
                Born in the coastal town of Taqah, Al-Somali initially worked with Omani
                musical legends such as Salim Ali Said, later gaining regional
                prominence through his collaborations with rising Khaleeji luminaries,
                including the likes of Abdullah Al-Ruwaishid, Abdul Rab Idris and
                Fatouma. He also wrote for the Qatari musician Ali Abd Al-Sattar,
                working on his classic 1989 Khaleeji retro-pop album <em>Ya Nas
                Ahibba</em>.</p>
                <p>Al-Somali’s collaborations with the Bahraini musician Khaled
                Al-Sheikh marked a significant turning point in the careers of both
                artists. I grew up on Al-Sheikh, a musical inheritance I received from
                my mother and her years spent in the Gulf. Al-Sheikh’s music transports
                me to the blare of kitchen radios, accompanied by the hiss of oil. For
                older generations, his songs reanimate the eighties in all their
                technicolor glow, a wash of sound and melodrama. They are wistful
                dispatches from a period of disorienting change, recalling the reckless
                speed and scale of urban development across the Gulf’s major cities. The
                eighties heralded the second stage of the petro-boom, an accelerating
                phase of modern state-building that would last through the new
                millennium. Along with runaway consumerism and changing tastes, these
                songs evoke a subtler landscape of memory. Walks by the palm tree-lined
                Corniche, decades before its engulfment by the air-conditioned shopping
                megacomplex. Sea air grazing your cheeks. Patches of desert, veins of
                highway. Buildings nestled together like rows of teeth. Souks still
                retaining their scruffy character. Old Towns still occupied by their
                inhabitants. Never being too far from a herd of goats, a few camels, a
                school of fish by the pier. Lives would be swallowed up by the calculus
                of migrant labour, remittances and return tickets, and the music itself
                is suffused by the tension between the endangered past and the hurtling
                future. A lifetime later, I play these songs, smitten by their plucked
                ouds and syncopated strains. I hum like my mother did, under my breath,
                soft and low, attuned to Al-Sheikh’s brooding, the wounded heart he
                laments in Classical Arabic.</p>
                <p><img class="img-text" src="imgs/notes-on-suspension/image1.jpg"/></p>
                <h4>A 1990 compilation of Khaled Al-Sheikh songs</h4>
                <p><em>O, light of my eyes</em>. Al-Sheikh falters. <em>O, solace of my
                    soul</em>. Al-Somali’s lyrics revel in poetic ambiguity, with the 1998
                    single “Yallah Bisamra” being one example. To hang. To dangle.
                    Etymologically speaking, these verbs share a root in the Arabic
                    language. A relationship is a form of a suspension. <em>I am hanging on
                    to you</em>, Al-Sheikh sings. Nostalgia is another form of entrapment.
                    The nostalgic is, as Svetlana Boym writes, a displaced person. He is
                    Orpheus, unable, or unwilling, to resist the pull of the backward
                    glance. Regularly, I choose to lie in a pit of second-hand nostalgia:
                    the YouTube comments section. Strangers reminisce over a Pan-Arab
                    reverie of ayam zaman, the yesteryears. Their schooldays, their
                    twenties, their youthful detours on long drives where they spent nights
                    in abandoned villages, sleeping on mats and looking up at the stars.
                    Al-Somali once said that his greatest reward as a poet was the
                    appreciation of simple citizens. I pore over the whip of memory, the
                    circuitry of love his words still provoke.</p>
                    <p>Trained in Cairo’s conservatories, Al-Sheikh was always greatly
                    influenced by poets, dipping into the poetry of Qassim Haddad, Mahmoud
                    Darwish and Nizar Qabbani, among others. From the Yemeni poetic canon to
                    the pelagic underworld of pearl divers, historical affinities trickle
                    through his songs. I often return to “Kulama Kunta Bi Qurbi” (Whenever
                    You Are Near Me), a song from Al-Sheikh’s 1983 debut album. It updates a
                    qasidah by the 13th century Andalusian philosopher-poet Abu al-Hasan
                    al-Shushtari. Dressed in rags and blazing with conviction, Al-Shushtari
                    was known as the prince of the poor. Like the state of <em>zuhd</em> he
                    clung to, the famed ascetic self-denial so beloved by Sufi mystics,
                    Al-Shushtari’s poems are exaltations stripped bare. “Have mercy on me
                    and see my condition,” he wrote, lauding his Beloved as both ailment and
                    cure. In Al-Sheikh’s hit, a delicate balance of octaves is backed by a
                    spirited ensemble. This is a musical interpretation defined by the tug
                    between innovation and restraint. A sense of rapture is transmitted, all
                    the way from its rhapsodic inception in the Maghreb to Bahrain and
                    beyond.</p>
                    <p>In his later years, Al-Somali would look back at his illustrious
                    career. His approach to composition may have been analytic, but he
                    maintained that the poems had a way of flooding out of him. He saw no
                    separation between his verses and his selfhood. When asked about the
                    melancholy saturating his work, he traced its roots back to the Arabic
                    literary canon, grounded in the formative pangs of the pre-Islamic era.
                    “As Arabs, it’s as if we are born into and suckled on sadness,” he
                    observed. This melancholy insinuates itself into the ears and hearts of
                    its listeners. The playlist shuffles, and I find myself moved to tears.
                    It doesn't help that these songs were once circulated through the 20th
                    century technologies of cassettes and VHS tapes, the universal vectors
                    of diasporic longing. These are songs of severance, portals to childhood
                    bedrooms, transient ties and iqamah-bound intimacies.</p>

                    <h4>Swahili songs performed on Kuwaiti television, 1960</h4>

                    <p>
O,<br>
Giver of pearls, shells and death<br>
The echo replies as if whimpering:<br>
“O, Gulf<br>
O. bestower of shells and death”<br>
The gulf scatters its plentiful gifts<br>
On the sand: a lather of salty water and shells<br>
And the remains of the drowned forlorn emigrant still<br>
Drinking death<br>
From the depths of the Gulf, from the ground of its silence<br>
<br>
— “Rain Song”, Badr Shakir Al-Sayyab<br>
</p>

<p>A chorus of men dance in unison, holding on to a rope. Their intimacy
    is partitioned. Behind them, women clap encouragingly. A drummer adds to
    the percussive flurry of hands. They sing of a nameless Somali man who
    has sold his boat and bought another. (The song’s title says as much).
    The performance was captured in 1965 and aired by Kuwaiti national
    television. Its synchronization of claps, tambourine and rebab is
    informed by the shaila genre, a lyrical art with folkloric origins.
    Shail can be loosely translated as the act of carrying, and these
    sheilat are defined by the audience exuberantly carrying the melody with
    the singers. The pentatonic scale belies African influences and the
    rhythms, like fann al-bahri (maritime arts), invoke the sea’s fury, the
    striking of oars and waves, the creaking hulls.</p>
    <p>The Somali seafarer is shrouded in mystery. We know Kuwaiti ships
    made their way to Berbera and Bosaso, reaching Ras Hafun, the
    easternmost tip of Africa. For centuries, Somalia’s ancient port cities
    have been sites of intercontinental trade, power struggles and cultural
    exchange. Even today, they are at the belligerent centre of geopolitical
    machinations. The Gulf of Aden was once known as the Gulf of Berbera,
    reflecting the city’s significance in Indian Ocean trading networks
    dating back to the 11th century which connected the Somali interior to
    the wider world. (Incidentally, the Indian rupee was the currency used
    in coastal towns such as Berbera, Zeila and Kismayo).</p>
    <p>Berbera’s most famed son, the poet Elmi Boodhari, died of a broken
    heart. He spent the 1930s pining, saddling his hometown with an
    indelible reputation for agonied love. A humble baker by profession, his
    poems would influence generations of poets and musicians. “But if you
    must profit from a poet’s words, should I withhold them?,” he wrote in
    the poem “Qaraami”, as if gifting his pain to his audience, letting us
    sift through its absoluteness. He lies buried at Batalaale Beach, the
    coastline a shudder away.</p>

        <h4>A lamentation from Khalid Al Saddiq’s 1972 film Bas Ya Bahar/ The
            Cruel Sea</h4>
            <p>The music of the Gulf is shaped by the entanglement of peripheries.
                Loan words litter the lyrics, mirroring the vernacular of sailors.
                Genres like Liwa connect the Swahili and Makran coasts. “The sea is
                always black, God,” one chant echoes. The scholar Saleh Hamdan Al-Harbi
                likened these songs to prayers, their rhythms in step with the physical
                tasks of dhow life. They helped pearl divers endure the sea voyage, with
                its risks and ravages of disease. The families they left behind composed
                their own songs too, expressing the hopes and fears of those condemned
                to watching and waiting. After all, the sea was a jealous companion. It
                could just as easily keep your loved ones to itself.</p>
                <p>At night, these archived performances would air on the Gulf’s
                national television channels. I was young, and my interest then was
                hardly scholarly. Still, in their grainy flicker, these songs fascinated
                me. They smoldered with life, imbued with the openness that
                distinguishes coastal life. If you listened closely, you could hear
                their influence everywhere. Nineties kids would dance to groups like
                Firqat Miami, a Kuwaiti outfit that conjured the old sheilat songs,
                melding Khaleeji rhythms with hip-hop. Black America’s pervasive impact
                on global youth culture was undeniable, though you could still note the
                maritime twists in the breaks, cyphers and referential nods to the
                folkloric OGs. The children of globalization had their own soundtrack.
                This was the era of dishdashas paired with Air Jordans, Spacetoon and
                baqala raids. MTV and Rotana. Miami was just another coastal hub. The
                sea was everywhere, even in our ears.</p>

                    <h3>Zanj-Bar, 2023</h3>

                    <p>As the departing ferry leaves behind the receding coastline of Dar es
                        Salaam, the haven of peace, all the intensity and beauty of the East
                        African coast wraps its golden light into the lively deck of travelling
                        school children, honey-mooners from the mainland and the vast array of
                        local tourists chatting excitedly. They are heading to the fabled
                        “island of Black people,” Zanzibar. This being my dream journey to the
                        island of my childhood after fifty years of being away from Tanzania, I
                        absorb the physicality of the distance, of how long it would have taken
                        all the people shipped from Bagamoyo to Zanzibar for centuries to
                        service the slave economy of the island. This history is never far away
                        from the festive, touristic ambience of the travellers to this island of
                        Zanj-bar, or ‘Black Coast’ in Arabic. The sea journey is deliriously
                        beautiful, the colours of the Indian Ocean refracting off the glistening
                        waves. The ocean air has its distinctive fragrance of salt and acidity
                        laced with the hot odour of sweat and breeze. It is a heady and
                        seductive sensation that absorbs its viewers as the breathtaking
                        coastline of Zanj-bar begins to rise in the distance.</p>
                        <p>It is December of 2023, and this journey to the island of the Black
                        Coast is the trip I have dreamt about since I was a child growing up in
                        the coastal city of Dar es Salaam. In the 1960s and 1970s, Zanzibar was
                        not accessible through tourism. It was a revolutionary island that
                        boasted an identity different from the mainland and for that reason, was
                        at once like an exotic ghost of the Haven of Peace and absent in the
                        mainland’s imagination. At school, I was taught that Zanzibar was
                        different from the mainland because it had Arabs, Asians and Africans
                        living closely for millennia and ultimately experienced a violent
                        revolution between Tanzanian nationalists and the island's local Arab
                        populations. My childhood in Dar Es Salaam was parallel to the shadowy
                        history of Zanzibar’s struggles for political sovereignty set against
                        the impinging coastal hegemony of mainland Tanzania. Zanzibar was out of
                        bounds for tourists. It existed in a constant state of emergency and
                        under military surveillance during the 1960s.</p>
                        <p>Now in 2023, imbibing the island air as we approach the extraordinary
                        archipelago, passing through Changu or Prison Island towards Unguja
                        Island, I realise that what Zanzibar had was a distinctive archipelagic
                        identity that was a crucible of the world, far different than the
                        coastal city of Dar es Salaam. Zanzibar was a microcosm of the world,
                        absorbing every traveller, every colonizer, and every trader alongside
                        the heinous history of the slave trade that brought entire populations
                        from the hinterlands of East and Central Africa to eventually reside in
                        Zanzibar after the abolishment of slavery. Zanzibar absorbed the history
                        of the world and also spat out its syncretic Arab-African-Asian
                        manifestations into the world, flung far and wide from Brazil to Oman,
                        India to Europe.</p>
                        <p>Arriving in the pell-mell of Stone Town’s docks throws one head-on
                        into the maelstrom of the centripetal forces that make this archipelago
                        so defining to both the world and Tanzania. I found myself relating to
                        the mainland in a way I had never imagined–from Zanzibar, Tanzania is
                        “the coast”. Locals who have lived in Zanzibar since the 1960s speak of
                        the coast with carefully veiled caution. The new prosperity has come at
                        the violent expense of their own history. In the marketplace on the
                        waterfront, I hear complaints from vendors that if they were not forced
                        to belong to the coast, they would be much better off. All of their
                        hard-earned profits go to “the coast”. While speaking in Swahili to all
                        and sundry, I run into descendants of ex-slaves whose families came from
                        Mombasa and Lamu and speak of the living stories from their ancestors
                        who were forcibly brought to the island. I soon realised, while chatting
                        with the smart young hospitality industry workers, that almost all the
                        young people I spoke to came from the mainland hinterlands, Tabora,
                        Mwanza, Arusha, Shinyanga, and Iringa. Zanzibar was the plum job on a
                        leisure island. In talking to local Zanzibaris along the streets I found
                        resentment towards the fact that while the cornucopia of global wealth
                        has flooded the Zanzibar tourist industry, this has not benefited the
                        lives of locals whose infrastructure and public health systems are
                        strained and direly underfunded. The sheer sprawl of hybridities of
                        Arab, African, and Asian histories across millennia on the island is
                        succeeded by the new global syncretisms of African and foreign tourists.
                        The sprawl opens up the liminal archipelago as a simulacra of multiple
                        time frames. The colonial histories of conquest and occupation in
                        Zanzibar merge with the post-Independence histories of mainland
                        Tanzanian migration to the Island for work alongside the new global
                        economy of eco-tourism. Somewhere along this intensely vibrant,
                        multilayered, deeply entwined mélange of networked histories lay the
                        foundation of my own reason for coming to Zanzibar. I was here to mourn
                        my family’s past. To remember and reimagine the lost history of 1964 and
                        what really happened. I wanted to see how the unique history of the
                        island’s past migrations had produced the distinctive palimpsestic
                        futures that are now spiralling outward into the world. On the island of
                        Zanzibar, I felt at home. Between Arab and African cultures, the Asian
                        continuities linked the mainland’s trading aesthetics with the island’s
                        maritime heritage. As I settled in Zanzibar, I could begin to revisit
                        the political reasons that led my family to leave “the coast”–
                        Dar-es-salaam – our haven of peace. It was a history linked to the era
                        of nationalisations, of Africanization, and of anti-Asian sentiments
                        that lay buried in the now-forgotten past of the early 1970s. The new
                        globalisation of the 2020s makes that distant socialist past seem
                        archaic and irrelevant somehow. But for the children of the
                        <em>Ujamaa</em> revolution, an unravelling, a connecting, a remembering
                        is still to be made. Zanzibar is the crucible from which one can look
                        back at the languorous expansive Tanzanian coast to ask the difficult
                        questions of loss, change, and history alongside the new
                        globalisation.</p>

                        <h3>Flashback: Dar-es-Salaam, 1972. Fear of being
Asian</h3>

<p>In the year 2022, the 50th anniversary of the expulsion of Asians
    from East Africa, a shift to the confessional mode seems appropriate. I
    remember 1972 viscerally. I was a precocious reader and regularly read
    <em>The Standard</em> which was at the time, the main newspaper of
    Tanzania. The horrific photographs of torture and the reporting of
    atrocities under Idi Amin remain imbedded in my mind. Images of fleeing
    Asians in airports, of bedraggled people in states of fear. I began to
    fear being Asian for the first time. I feared for my family and of what
    would happen if Amin invaded us across the border. Fear was the single
    emotion I remember from 1972 until we left in 1975. The fear was
    inchoate, palpable, constant, low grade, but always there. It was
    tangible because my father worked in a prominent company in Dar Es
    Salaam. Any Asian in a managerial position during the mid-1970s was a
    clear target. There were very few to begin with, but the numbers
    dwindled quickly under the nationalisation policies that swept the
    country.</p>
    <p>Soon, my family was part of the exodus out of Tanzania. Father was
    relieved of his post, as many Asians in managerial positions had been
    under the new naturalisation rules.<sup class="footNote" id="fn22">22</sup> By this point, we had
    endured many sleepless nights over the years and lived with a constant
    fear that the death threats against the Asian managerial class would of
    the death threats against Father as an Asian manager might come to pass.
    The ousting of Asians from their posts was linked to Asian workers
    challenging or exposing corruption going on in the workplace. Asians
    during the 1970s were very vulnerable as a professional class. Any
    critique of the upper administration by Asians frequently resulted in
    their eventual dismissal.</p>
    <p>On the school front, I came of age where the state was nationalised
    and Africanized without the infrastructure in place to fully support the
    transition. As such, my generation, the 1967 generation, can claim that
    we learned our lessons in the streets of Dar Es Salaam. As it was a
    period of intense upheaval, there were no trained African school
    teachers. People with minimal high school education taught primary
    school classes in Swahili. At Forodhani Primary School along the
    Gerezani waterfront, the demographic was majority African. The
    smattering of non-indigenous Tanzanian students included Zanzibaris of
    Arab descent who had fled the 1964 revolution and a mix of Tanzania’s
    Asian ethnicities, Ismaili, Bohora, Gujurathi, Goans and Sikh. By the
    time I got to secondary school, I was the only Asian student in the
    class. All instruction was in Kiswahili, which meant I failed in most
    classes as my Swahili was mediocre. My classmates were part of the new
    Tanzania, kids whose parents were not allowed the dignity of being human
    under the British.</p>
    <p>The euphoria was palpable. My classmates were the first generation of
    African students to go to school. They were typically several years
    older than I was and were children of the lumpenproletariat - our
    classroom was chaotic and lively. It got the sense that there was a lot
    at stake for us to study in Swahili. It was a historically new space and
    the President communicated this fact in no uncertain terms. As primary
    school kids, we understood this in earnest. We swept the school grounds
    every morning, marched daily, and learned to call each other “Ndugu” in
    order to avoid all forms of racial or ethnic distinctions. The handful
    of Asians in the government schools I attended were scattered throughout
    the different years. I did not have an Asian classmate in my higher
    education at Azania Secondary School, so my sense of the time is as much
    evocative as it is mnemonic.</p>
    <p>The Africanization of Tanzania’s private schools, many of which were
    started and run by Asians, meant there was integration through social
    upheaval. Compulsory use of Swahili in the classroom meant a certain
    immersive assimilation of Asians into the cultural milieu. At the
    primary school level, this chaotic transition from English to Swahili
    meant what was taught was very rudimentary and largely consisted of the
    memorisation of the Arusha Declaration in primary school. However, the
    real success of the first decade of this vernacularisation of education
    was the larger effort at youth literacy that Swahilisation engendered.
    Children of farmers and peasants were learning to read and write in
    their national language for the first time. It was meant as a conscious
    process of decoloniality, of unlearning colonial subjugation and
    relearning a new politics of freedom. An ethics of liberation was
    tangibly underway.</p>
    <p>At the level of the public sphere, drastic economic decisions were
    being undertaken to address the precarious position of Tanzanian
    exports. The expropriation of property became a key site of contestation
    affecting Tanzanian Asians. Specifically, the dramatic economic changes
    following the Nationalization Laws of 1967 and the Buildings Acquisition
    Act of 1971 launched a decimating assault on the legitimacy of Asian
    livability in Tanzania.<sup class="footNote" id="fn23">23</sup> Fear and anxiety accompanied daily
    life. Being a Tanzanian Asian became viscerally stressful. The random
    assault on one’s person for being Asian was not uncommon for
    school-going kids as the anti-Asian sentiment accelerated during the
    mid-1970s. The random stone thrown at you or being spat on was always a
    possibility. This new era of anti-Asian sentiment was a means of
    detracting from the pressing concerns of corruption, nepotism, graft and
    political favouritism shaping local politics, making it nearly
    impossible for Tanzanian Asians to find a means of legitimacy during
    those tumultuous years.</p>

    <h3>An Invisible Grief</h3>

    <p>My family left Tanzania on August 25, 1975. I remember the date
        because we landed in Addis Ababa on the day the airport had been taken
        over by the military following the assassination of Haile Selaisse.
        There was chaos at the airport, and my little suitcase with everything I
        owned was lost in Addis Ababa. My precious books, my cool African
        clothes and my rare stamp collection. I arrived in Bangalore, India,
        with my entire childhood missing - I had lost my bearings. I had a
        nervous breakdown. However, amidst the greater chaos of my parents’
        forced displacement, their emotional shock, and my formerly energetic
        and optimistic father’s resulting depression, my own crisis passed under
        the radar.</p>
        <p>What helped me to make sense of our forced displacement in the
        ensuing years was the experience of meeting other Swahili-speaking East
        African Asians in Bangalore. I began meeting kids whose parents had lost
        their language. Most families had lost all of their savings. I still
        retain this image of a former Ugandan school teacher, the mother of a
        friend of mine. She had lost her voice entirely out of shock, dressed
        shabbily, and would just rock her chair silently all day. Other Ugandan
        families transplanted to Bangalore sought help from church charities to
        get back on their feet.</p>
        <p>In Dar Es Salaam, the occasional tragic story of an acquaintance of
        my parents who committed suicide by walking into the ocean in despair
        coloured this period. Other families collapsed in a spiral of shock
        before gradually finding their feet in India. Bangalore was a haven for
        East African Asians returning in different states of shock and grief
        over their upended lives and lost savings. Gradually, these displaced
        peoples of East Africa began to open stores and commercial
        establishments in Bangalore. They spoke Swahili amongst themselves. A
        little bit of East Africa in Bangalore.</p>
        <p>I never wanted to leave Dar Es Salaam. Dar was my home. My dream was
        to go to college at the University of Nairobi or maybe Makerere. Leaving
        Dar Es Salaam was unimaginable. It happened very quickly. I had not been
        prepared for the transplant to India, where no one understood anything
        about the beautiful and dramatic utopia I had come from - even with all
        its political turmoils.</p>
        <p>Life was vibrant, growing up in Upanga. It was Afro-Arab-Asian
        culturally. Our building neighbours were ultracool Afro-American
        radicals with the latest Black-American music throbbing through the
        walls. The opera sounds from our boisterous gun-owning Italian neighbour
        introduced me to what I now recognize as Luciano Pavarotti. My mother
        taught African history and Physical Education at Kisutu Secondary School
        and was the one who introduced me to Ngugi Wa Thiong'o, as she was part
        of the first group of African teachers to teach his works in the
        1960s.</p>
        <p>Daily life, culturally, was Muslim in intonation, from the day's
        greetings to food prohibitions. I walked to school every day, danced
        ngomas at school, and practised Bharatanatyam at home regularly. My
        afternoons were spent cycling around the bougainvillaea neighbourhoods
        in the lazy cloudless streets, enjoying classical Karnatic music and
        playing street hockey with neighbourhood kids. We ate Biriyani by the
        beach and enjoyed sun-drenched Sundays frolicking in the lime green
        gentle ocean. Sometimes a garrulous three-hour Hindi movie at the
        Drive-In alongside popcorn and Coca-Cola would wrap up a special week.
        Kariakoo market was a must every weekend to buy fresh fish and
        vegetables with my father. As kids we enjoyed the sea breeze, drank
        coconut water with roasted corn while watching wrestling matches by the
        harbour. I loved watching those wrestling performances while the fishing
        boats came in with their daily catch. I even had a pet wild monkey who
        would show up every day at 4 pm to receive a banana from me. I cried a
        lot about who would feed him when we left.</p>
        <p>The one striking sensation I did notice through my own teenage
        depression in Bangalore was that I no longer experienced fear, despite
        being despondent about this displacement. Here in India, no one cared
        about how I looked. It suddenly was a lot easier for me to get around
        without being targeted as a minority. I would always be a Tanzanian but
        this new condition of no longer being a minority in my adopted home was
        a new kind of possibility I thrived in. I began to find language and to
        speak again.</p>

        <h3>East African Affect</h3>

        <p>For a place I have yet to visit, ‘Uganda’ is a word that shaped much
            of my childhood. I have never been there, but as a young high school
            student in Dar Es Salaam in the 1970s, I aspired to one day gain
            admission into Makerere University. Ugali, matoke, and mandazi were
            staple delicacies in our home and my mother often cooked a wonderful
            ‘Indianized’ matoke dish that had been taught to her by a close Ugandan
            friend. Then came Idi Amin, and the life of my family and those of all
            our friends and acquaintances who were East African Asians changed
            forever. Uganda became an affectual experience of political
            disenchantment that followed us. It represented a place of great beauty
            and a symbol of a terrible calamity for Asians in East Africa. Uganda
            was a lost love and a warning to never forget that once an immigrant,
            always an immigrant; you just never knew.</p>
            <p>Lately, with the punitive legislation against the Dreamers and the
            anti-immigration policies of the United States, along with the attending
            incarcerations, deportations, home invasions and physical and police
            abuse of communities who have lived in the U.S for decades, I have been
            feeling the inchoate anxiety that I have come to understand as the
            Ugandan effect.</p>
            <p>It is terrible to invoke specific places, such as Cambodia under Pol
            Pot, Uganda under Idi Amin, and now the United States under Donald
            Trump, in ways that reduce and simplify complex processes and
            consequences. However, in the light of fifty years since the expulsion
            of Asians from Uganda, perhaps this is a time to articulate unspoken
            effects and repressed sentiments.</p>
            <p>Part of the legacy of being Asian from East Africa is my anxiety
            about my family being deported in the manner of our friends in Kampala
            and Entebbe. My anxieties related to sudden political announcements are
            rooted in the fear I had about the possibility of my father suddenly
            disappearing. He had received multiple death threats during the early
            1970s as Asians began to be expelled from Kenya and Uganda. As described
            earlier in this essay, these fears were not entirely irrational and the
            reason we left Tanzania in 1975 was because Father was sacked under the
            naturalisation laws and given one month to pack and leave the country if
            he wanted to keep his savings. This was kinder than what was happening
            to Asians in Uganda. After twenty years in Tanzania, our lives were
            upended by the shame of sudden dismissals, silences, depression,
            uncertain futures, financial catastrophe and a sense of shock that never
            quite left our bodily memories of Tanzania. Tanzania was my home. I was
            born here. I was part of the revolution. A hasty unexpected farewell was
            not possible.</p>
            <h3>East Africa in India</h3>
            <p>My arrival in Bangalore, India in 1975 marked a new chapter of being
                Asian-African. Bangalore emerged as a transnational African hub for the
                less affluent refugees from the East African expulsions while the
                wealthier refugees fled to the U.K. and Canada. Bangalore in the 1970s
                was a bucolic garden paradise with lush gardens, quiet laid back streets
                and a restful air. It was a perfect respite for healing from a traumatic
                and fear-filled departure from our home. Bangalore forced us to shift
                from identifying as Tanzanian, Kenyan or Ugandan Asian and encouraged us
                instead to identify as East African. This was the case for many kids who
                had grown up in East Africa like myself and had found themselves in
                India overnight. This identitarian transformation occurred as India was
                still a closed economy, with most Indians having little to no exposure
                to Africa or African cultures. Europe and the West were considered the
                only desirable places for migration at the time with Singapore or
                Malaysia as exceptions to the rule. Africa was a distant thought. This
                was the general attitude of my cohorts at school for whom there was no
                understanding of the Asian-African condition. We were a strange lot and
                were read as culturally African. For Asian Africans such as myself, the
                shift from modern, metropolitan, cosmopolitan Dar Es Salaam to
                provincial and homogenous Bangalore where no one knew my cultural roots,
                was a devastating experience. I had a nervous breakdown. I lost my
                language. But as is the Indian way, my neural disassociation was ignored
                amidst the family mayhem of reintegration into a new culture of Indian
                living. Boarding school was a happy healing place, where I met other
                kids from East Africa who had a similar experience of displacement and
                disorientation. At boarding school, I began to glean a wider picture of
                East African fallout–kids whose parents had fallen into depression and
                silence and the other kids whose parents lost everything they had made.
                While I missed Dar es Salaam, my life, my friends, and the streets I had
                mastered on my bicycle, I considered myself lucky to have our family
                intact unlike so many of our East African acquaintances whose families
                had been destroyed by the expulsions. Language began to return and panic
                receded.</p>
                <h3>The Island and The Coast</h3>
                <p>Unguja (or the main island of Zanzibar) bears the physical brunt of
                    the new nation of Tanzania. It harbours the deep injuries of nation
                    formation as it was robbed of its auxiliary languages, Arabic, Urdu,
                    Gujarati and Kutchi towards the creation of its Swahili imagining in
                    1964. The island has been the distant echo of the mainland’s ambitions.
                    Standing on Unguja and looking back at Dar es Salaam, one gets the sense
                    that the price Unguja paid for being annexed to Tanganyika continues to
                    reverberate. Two tangible consequences of Zanzibar’s annexation to the
                    mainland are the exile of its Arab-descended populations which have
                    subsequently spread around the world, as well as the unreconciled
                    tensions between the Arab, Asian, and African syncretisms. These
                    histories continue to rub up against the ongoing influx of mainland
                    ethnicities who work on the island but have no interest or understanding
                    of its past nor their impact on Zanzibar’s present. The colliding
                    centrifugal power of Zanzibar’s past alongside its centripetal effects
                    on the tremors of world history which it continues to intersect with,
                    makes the island now more powerful than the coast. Zanzibar’s rising
                    global prominence can only lead to a new volatility between the island
                    and the coast as language becomes surreptitious, cautious and
                    clandestine in the face of rising island resentment for the coast.</p>

                    <p>Produced in the decades between 1940 and 1960, <em>Qaraami</em> is
                        Somali Classical Music hailing from the Afro-Asian Red Sea. The magical
                        sounds of the <em>oud</em> embody the soul of this classical literary
                        production. Somali poetry, which tends toward metric rigidity and
                        strictness in alliteration, softens when it meets the rhythms of Arabic
                        poetry. This allows poets to express themselves with simple words,
                        transcending the restrictions of long verses typical of Somali poetry.
                        The Arabic and Persian rhythms blend with the Afrobeat of continental
                        drums, sparking a magnificent light. What comes out of this sonic
                        encounter is the <em>Qaraami</em>, a unique, almost effortless
                        expression of love. In writing my book about the history of this
                        particular era of literary production, I hope to preserve this practice
                        for future generations.</p>
                        <p><em>Qaraami</em> lyrics inherit many attributes from indigenous
                        sources and traditional poetry. However, when recited in song, it
                        borrows many features from foreign sources and incorporates
                        individualised melodies into the genre. While the influence of Arabic
                        and Indian culture on <em>Qaraami</em> is evident, it extends more
                        broadly towards what is understood as modern Somali art. The late
                        Abdullahi Qarshi, known as the father of Qaraami, speaks of this
                        influence and has pioneered the genre and composed many of these Qaraami
                        melodies. In an interview from 1994 (refer to Mohamed-Rashid, 2008),
                        Qarshi affirms:</p>
                        
                        <p class="internalQuote"><em>"During the Second World War, the British authorities in Aden
                            established a radio station. Among the foreign languages broadcast were
                            Hindi, Arabic, and Somali, which were given half an hour airtime. Both
                            the Hindi and Arabic programs included music, but the Somali broadcast
                            did not. A newsreader called Mahdi Eleeye read the news that was
                            followed by classical Somali poetry (gabay) and took the remainder of
                            the time. When Arabs visited Somali cafes, they would ask them, “Don’t
                            you have your own music?” As I said earlier, my taste for music was
                            first inspired by Indian music, and later I realized that broadcasters
                            in the Arabic department were also using some aspects of Indian music
                            and incorporating it into their melodies. Hence, I thought of doing the

                            <p>The decision to write a book about <em>Qaraami</em> stems from a
                                decades-long conversation with myself on the future of music and
                                entertainment in our society. There have been ongoing debates within
                                many different parts of our society about music production in
                                Somaliland. This was an important debate that I would like to facilitate
                                without formally entering into the conversation. It is a debate which is
                                taking place in many other societies, predominantly of Muslim heritage.
                                The purpose of this book project is not to enter that debate, despite
                                the fact that I am generally in favour of the production of music. I
                                have however realised that in the meantime, something essential is being
                                lost, and this time for good, if we don’t do the work of documenting and
                                sharing with the current and future generations so that they might be
                                prepared for and take part in this ongoing debate. The entertainment
                                industry lost its prestige a long time ago in the Somali context, in
                                part due to the introduction of new technologies which have shifted the
                                emphasis to social media. More importantly however, this shift is also
                                due to the overall destruction of cultural infrastructure (theatre,
                                school of art, home for art and culture, protection for artists, etc) in
                                the late 1980s. Hargeysa, a capital city that hosts a population of
                                almost 1.2 million people and which has enjoyed progressive peace and
                                prosperity for three decades, the lack of a national theatre is a
                                testament to the difficulty surrounding the revival of music and
                                artistic expression in our society. Let us start then by exploring “what
                                is being lost?”</p>
                                <div class="poem">***</div>
                                <p>Music acts as both a universal language and as a cultural product in
                                each society. Though music is produced within the boundaries of a
                                particular society, enforcing concepts like ownership or creative
                                possession, it takes on new meanings and interpretations as well as a
                                sense of universality as it transcends these boundaries and is shared
                                worldwide. For example, in a 2019 study conducted by Harvard University,
                                researchers analysed a song’s acoustic features like tonality,
                                ornamentation, and tempo and how people could actually understand the
                                meaning regardless of their cultural backgrounds (Mehr et al, 2019). In
                                a conversation with camel herders in Somaliland, I asked them how
                                certain work songs help their camels and their behaviour while the
                                camels are drinking water or to manage their pace on long journeys. They
                                told me that while the camels don’t understand the beautiful lyrics of
                                their songs, they react to the pitch and rhythm of the song. When the
                                herder wants his camels to move quickly, line up, and drink their water,
                                he sings with a quicker rhythm that creates the path on which the camels
                                line up. When the camels stop drinking but the herder needs to make sure
                                they have enough water for their journey, he changes the rhythm to a
                                slower, more relaxed tempo. The lyrics also change to reflect what the
                                owner wants to communicate, but what the camels react to is the
                                tonality, ornamentation, and tempo of the song. According to the Harvard
                                study, we are similarly able to understand and relate to a song’s
                                psychological meaning, whether it's a dance track, a love song, a
                                healing melody, or soothing lullaby (see also Gottlieb, 2019). If we
                                lose music, we lose a universal language, a self-expressive tool of
                                sentimental codes.</p>
                                <div class="poem">***</div>
                                <p>Music is not "a fixed inventory of cultural behaviours" of the
                                society that produces it. Researchers at Harvard state that music is
                                instead "the product of underlying psychological faculties that make
                                certain kinds of sound feel appropriate to certain social and emotional
                                circumstances." Music is linked to specific perceptual, cognitive, and
                                affective faculties, including language. Societies use words and motor
                                controls, as well as auditory analysis, since all musical systems have
                                signatures of tonality and aesthetics. Their melodies and rhythms differ
                                and strike a balance between monotony and chaos. The beauty of music
                                lies between its local production and sentiments as well as the
                                universality of human understanding. Love is a feeling and historically,
                                every society has had its own way of expressing it. Love songs and their
                                musical interpretations have been recurrent in the literary productions
                                and musical arrangements in every society. In modern Somali art,
                                <em>Qaraami</em> has played that role. <em>Qaraami</em> lyrics and
                                melodies were coined exclusively to express love, and that new kind of
                                literature in Somali oral poetry that began in the 1940s and 1950s
                                finally laid the foundation for the new modern Somali song. Documenting
                                <em>Qaraami</em> music into the written form is to bridge orality to
                                written culture.</p>
                                <div class="poem">***</div>
                                <p>In the process of creating this bridge, I believe that any attempt to
                                radically transform our society should begin with morphing our rich oral
                                tradition into a well-sustained culture based on reading and writing. I
                                hold this practice as an essential requisite that enables our people,
                                mainly the younger generation, to have access to our various fields of
                                knowledge. This practice can help level them with this dynamically
                                advancing world and contribute to its ongoing development while also
                                having access to the history and identity to which they also belong.</p>
                                <p>This entails a long process of demanding collective work, dedication,
                                endurance, and relentlessness. First and foremost however, it requires
                                imagination. This imagination facilitates space for the transformation
                                of the orally held traditions and customs in the form of narration: a
                                book entry, novel, academic publication that comes back to the
                                community, or musical notations for authentic melodies. At the Hargeysa
                                Cultural Centre, we uphold this central mission and train our youth in
                                creative and academic writing in order to transmit ideas and
                                inspirations from the older generations to the younger ones. Beyond
                                writing, we also offer lessons in <em>Oud</em> playing as well as other
                                traditional musical instruments. <em>Oud</em> or <em>Kaman</em>
                                (<em>Kaban</em>) is considered the companion of <em>Qaraami</em> in love
                                songs, and as Christina Woolner states in her book “,Love Songs in
                                Motion - Voicing Intimacy in Somaliland”, the instrument’s "sounding
                                evokes sentiments of love-suffering and its relief, war and its
                                complicated aftermath, frustration, pain, joy, and desire" (Woolner,
                                2023).</p>
                                <p>The number of publications that are part of the written word of the
                                Somali community is continuously increasing particularly in the
                                aftermath of the introduction of the yearly trainings as part of the
                                Hargeysa International Book Fair. We celebrate this transformation from
                                the oral to the written, especially with regards to the forms of culture
                                that we run the risk of losing. It is also important to ensure that when
                                these works are preserved, that the work is done in the local language.
                                More effort should be put into standardising and developing the lexicon
                                by introducing new scientific and technology terminology since it is
                                linked with the advancements within the community and the inevitable
                                impact of globalisation. Most of the critical historical and social
                                indigenous knowledge of the community is still in the oral domain.
                                <em>Qaraami</em> is a fundamental part of this production, and it needs
                                to be preserved in a written form, which is what I aimed to do in my
                                book: Qaraami: The fading melody of Somali classic music.</p>
                                <div class="poem">***</div>
                                <p>Climate change and urbanisation have affected the ways in which we
                                think about and produce literature. The global impact of urbanisation
                                and technological intervention has transformed the nomadic way of life,
                                impacting art-based expressions and contributing to their disappearance.
                                Several artistic elements that were once hallmarks of the Somali
                                community are now invisible. Young people, for example, no longer see
                                pottery as something essential to their way of life and everyday tools
                                at home. The commercial sector has replaced pottery with ceramics and
                                plastic utensils, removing not only the physical pots from the home but
                                the practice of pottery-making and the related performances. These
                                practices are not fully documented and are typically preserved only
                                orally. Rapid technological development has led to the disappearance of
                                these performances and has also relegated craft to a lower-status,
                                peripheral activity of the past. This has eroded the culture and value
                                that could also have been a strong source of income. If this
                                transformation is putting various forms of art at risk, the
                                entertainment practice faces another challenge.</p>
                                <p>Traditional and pastoral musical performances are at high risk of
                                disappearance. This includes the songs mothers sing to their babies for
                                entertainment or to lull them into a peaceful sleep. It also includes
                                the work songs that people used to sing while working together building
                                traditional houses, looking after camels, or fetching water. These songs
                                are not as visible as they once were, particularly because advancing
                                urban culture has eroded the traditions even within more rural
                                areas.</p>
                                <p>It is also important to highlight ‘Soundscape’ - one of our
                                interventions at the Hargeysa Cultural Centre. Soundscape is an attempt
                                to record, collect, and preserve these traditional songs and sounds
                                which are at a high risk of disappearance. Through this project we
                                create the tangible evidence necessary to narrate the stories of our
                                community and instil a sense of pride in the younger generation who are
                                deprived of this cultural identity. The emerging extremism and war
                                against music comes in the form of shaming artists, prohibiting musical
                                performance at ceremonies like weddings, and other quite worrying
                                restraints that endanger our music.</p>

                                <p>In conclusion, writing a book on <em>Qaraami</em> was and remains
                                instrumentally helpful in documenting artistic identity, preserving
                                Somali modern art, and encouraging today’s generation of music producers
                                to rely on and learn from past traditions.</p>
                                <p>Change is inevitable. Nevertheless, documenting and reviving this
                                defining characteristic of our society is the responsibility of each and
                                every one of us. Understanding the vulnerability of orally archived
                                cultural and social heritage is the foundation for this book.
                                Documenting this authentic, powerful, and enchanting element of Somali
                                society is like planting the seed of rejuvenating the performance and
                                beautiful scenery it exhibits. With <em>Qaraami</em>, we continue the
                                intergenerational dialogue on art production. In an era where the second
                                orality is coming into force through social media, having a richly
                                documented musical notation for the <em>Qaraami</em> (and in general
                                Somali music), helps our society share with the rest of the world one of
                                its great contributions to humanity.</p>
                                <p>We conclude with the translation of a selected set of 36 stanzas from
                                well-known <em>Qaraami</em> lyrics played with different melodies in
                                different times and translated into English:</p>
